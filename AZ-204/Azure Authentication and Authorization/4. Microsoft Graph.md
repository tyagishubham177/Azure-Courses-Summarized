# Discover Microsoft Graph

Microsoft Graph is the gateway to data and intelligence in Microsoft 365. It provides a unified programmability model to access data across Microsoft 365, Windows 10, and Enterprise Mobility + Security.

## Components of Microsoft Graph

1. **Microsoft Graph API**
   - **Endpoint:** `https://graph.microsoft.com`
   - **Access Methods:** REST APIs or SDKs
   - **Services:**
     - Manage user and device identity
     - Access and compliance
     - Security
     - Protect organizations from data leakage or loss

2. **Microsoft Graph Connectors**
   - **Function:** Import external data into Microsoft Graph services and applications
   - **Enhance Experiences:** Improve Microsoft 365 experiences like Microsoft Search
   - **Supported Data Sources:** Box, Google Drive, Jira, Salesforce, etc.

3. **Microsoft Graph Data Connect**
   - **Purpose:** Streamline secure and scalable delivery of Microsoft Graph data to Azure data stores
   - **Usage:** Provide data sources for Azure development tools
   - **Application:** Build intelligent applications using cached data

## Key Features

- **Unified Endpoint:** Simplifies API requests to a single URL.
- **Extensible Platform:** Allows integration with various external data sources through connectors.
- **Intelligent Applications:** Leverage data from Microsoft 365 for advanced analytics and app development.

# Query Microsoft Graph Using REST

Microsoft Graph is a RESTful web API that allows you to access Microsoft Cloud service resources. After registering your app and obtaining authentication tokens for a user or service, you can make requests to the Microsoft Graph API.

## Structure of a Request

To read from or write to a resource, construct a request as follows:

```
{HTTP method} https://graph.microsoft.com/{version}/{resource}?{query-parameters}
```

### Components of a Request

- **{HTTP method}:** The HTTP method used on the request (GET, POST, PATCH, PUT, DELETE).
- **{version}:** The version of the Microsoft Graph API (v1.0 or beta).
- **{resource}:** The resource you're referencing (e.g., me, user, group).
- **{query-parameters}:** Optional OData query options or REST method parameters.

### Example Request

```
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/messages?filter=emailAddress eq 'jon@contoso.com'
```

## HTTP Methods

| Method | Description                                 |
|--------|---------------------------------------------|
| GET    | Read data from a resource.                  |
| POST   | Create a new resource, or perform an action.|
| PATCH  | Update a resource with new values.          |
| PUT    | Replace a resource with a new one.          |
| DELETE | Remove a resource.                          |

- **GET and DELETE:** No request body required.
- **POST, PATCH, and PUT:** Require a request body in JSON format with additional information.

## API Versions

- **v1.0:** Generally available APIs, use for production apps.
- **beta:** APIs in preview, use for testing apps in development.

## Resources

A resource can be an entity or complex type, often defined with properties. Resources include:

- **Entities:** Include an id property (e.g., me, user, group).
- **Relationships:** Access related resources (e.g., me/messages, me/drive).
- **Methods:** Perform actions on resources (e.g., me/sendMail).

## Query Parameters

Query parameters customize the response, such as including more properties or filtering items.

### Example Query Parameter

To filter messages by email address:
```
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/messages?filter=emailAddress eq 'jon@contoso.com'
```

# Query Microsoft Graph Using SDKs

The Microsoft Graph SDKs simplify building applications that access Microsoft Graph by providing a service library and a core library.

## SDK Components

- **Service Library:** Contains models and request builders generated from Microsoft Graph metadata.
- **Core Library:** Enhances interactions with Microsoft Graph, providing features like retry handling, secure redirects, transparent authentication, payload compression, paging through collections, and creating batch requests.

## Available SDKs

- **Microsoft.Graph:** Models and request builders for v1.0 endpoint.
- **Microsoft.Graph.Beta:** Models and request builders for beta endpoint.
- **Microsoft.Graph.Core:** Core library for making calls to Microsoft Graph.

## Install the Microsoft Graph .NET SDK

Install the necessary NuGet packages:
- `Microsoft.Graph`
- `Microsoft.Graph.Beta`
- `Microsoft.Graph.Core`

## Create a Microsoft Graph Client

The Microsoft Graph client simplifies making calls to Microsoft Graph. Use a single client instance for the application's lifetime. The authentication provider handles acquiring access tokens.

### Example: Create a Microsoft Graph Client

```csharp
var scopes = new[] { "User.Read" };
var tenantId = "common"; // Use tenant ID for single-tenant apps
var clientId = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID";

var options = new TokenCredentialOptions
{
    AuthorityHost = AzureAuthorityHosts.AzurePublicCloud
};

Func<DeviceCodeInfo, CancellationToken, Task> callback = (code, cancellation) => {
    Console.WriteLine(code.Message);
    return Task.FromResult(0);
};

var deviceCodeCredential = new DeviceCodeCredential(callback, tenantId, clientId, options);
var graphClient = new GraphServiceClient(deviceCodeCredential, scopes);
```

## Read Information from Microsoft Graph

### Example: Get User Information

```csharp
// GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me
var user = await graphClient.Me.GetAsync();
```

## Retrieve a List of Entities

### Example: Get Messages with Query Parameters

```csharp
// GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/messages?$select=subject,sender&$filter=<some condition>&orderBy=receivedDateTime
var messages = await graphClient.Me.Messages
    .Request()
    .Select(m => new { m.Subject, m.Sender })
    .Filter("<filter condition>")
    .OrderBy("receivedDateTime")
    .GetAsync();
```

## Delete an Entity

### Example: Delete a Message

```csharp
// DELETE https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/messages/{message-id}
string messageId = "AQMkAGUy...";
await graphClient.Me.Messages[messageId].Request().DeleteAsync();
```

## Create a New Entity

### Example: Create a Calendar

```csharp
// POST https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/calendars
var calendar = new Calendar { Name = "Volunteer" };
var newCalendar = await graphClient.Me.Calendars.Request().AddAsync(calendar);
```

# Best Practices for Microsoft Graph

Applying best practices ensures your application is reliable and secure while using Microsoft Graph.

## Authentication

- **Acquire Access Token:** Use OAuth 2.0 to get an access token.
  - **Methods:**
    - HTTP Authorization request header as a Bearer token.
    - Microsoft Graph client constructor when using a client library.
  - **Library:** Use Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) to acquire the token.

## Consent and Authorization

- **Least Privilege:** Request only necessary permissions and only when needed.
  - Check the permissions section in API method topics.
- **Correct Permission Type:**
  - **Delegated Permissions:** For interactive applications with a signed-in user.
  - **Application Permissions:** For applications without a signed-in user (background service or daemon).

**Caution:** Using application permissions for interactive scenarios can pose compliance and security risks. Ensure users don't gain undesired access or circumvent policies.

- **End User and Admin Experience:**
  - Consider who will consent (end users or administrators) and configure permissions accordingly.
  - Understand static, dynamic, and incremental consent.
  
- **Multi-Tenant Applications:** 
  - Be aware of various consent controls in different tenant states.
  - Handle 403 error responses when acting on behalf of a user due to custom authorization policies.

## Handling Responses Effectively

- **Pagination:** 
  - Microsoft Graph may return results in multiple pages due to server-side limits.
  - Use `@odata.nextLink` to obtain the next set of results.
  - The final page won't include `@odata.nextLink`.

- **Evolvable Enumerations:**
  - Microsoft Graph API may add new members to existing enumerations.
  - By default, GET operations return only known members.
  - Handle unknown members using an HTTP Prefer request header to receive all members.

## Storing Data Locally

- **Real-Time Retrieval:** 
  - Retrieve data in real time as necessary.
  - Cache or store data locally only if necessary for a specific scenario.
  - Ensure compliance with your terms of use, privacy policy, and Microsoft APIs Terms of Use.
  - Implement proper retention and deletion policies.
