# Discover Shared Access Signatures (SAS)

A shared access signature (SAS) is a signed URI that grants access to Azure storage resources. The URI includes a token with query parameters indicating how the resources can be accessed by the client. The signature within the token authorizes access based on SAS parameters and is signed with the key used to create the SAS.

## Types of Shared Access Signatures

- **User Delegation SAS:** 
  - Secured with Microsoft Entra credentials.
  - Applies to Blob storage only.
  - Permissions specified for the SAS.
  
- **Service SAS:** 
  - Secured with the storage account key.
  - Delegates access to resources in Blob, Queue, Table storage, or Azure Files.

- **Account SAS:** 
  - Secured with the storage account key.
  - Delegates access to resources in one or more storage services.
  - Includes all operations available via service or user delegation SAS.

**Note:** Microsoft recommends using Microsoft Entra credentials over the account key for enhanced security. Use user delegation SAS for accessing Blob storage when possible.

## How Shared Access Signatures Work

To access data with a SAS, you need:
1. **URI:** Points to the resource.
2. **SAS Token:** Authorizes access.

Example URI with SAS token:
```
https://medicalrecords.blob.core.windows.net/patient-images/patient-116139-nq8z7f.jpg?sp=r&st=2020-01-20T11:42:32Z&se=2020-01-20T19:42:32Z&spr=https&sv=2019-02-02&sr=b&sig=SrW1HZ5Nb6MbRzTbXCaPm%2BJiSEn15tC91Y4umMPwVZs%3D
```

### Components of a SAS Token

| Component    | Description                                                                                                                                               |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `sp=r`       | Access rights: `a` (add), `c` (create), `d` (delete), `l` (list), `r` (read), `w` (write). Example `sp=acdlrw` grants all rights.                         |
| `st=...`     | Start time for access.                                                                                                                                    |
| `se=...`     | End time for access. Example grants eight hours of access.                                                                                                |
| `sv=...`     | Storage API version to use.                                                                                                                               |
| `sr=...`     | Storage type: `b` (blob).                                                                                                                                 |
| `sig=...`    | Cryptographic signature.                                                                                                                                  |

## Best Practices for Using SAS

- **Use HTTPS:** Securely distribute SAS to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **User Delegation SAS:** Prefer this method for enhanced security, managed via Microsoft Entra ID.
- **Set Expiration Time:** Minimize the time window to reduce risk if a SAS key is compromised.
- **Minimum Privileges:** Grant only necessary access (e.g., read-only if sufficient).
- **Alternative Solutions:** For high-risk scenarios, use a middle-tier service to manage access instead of a direct SAS.

# Choose When to Use Shared Access Signatures (SAS)

## Overview
Use a SAS when you want to provide secure access to resources in your storage account to any client who doesn't otherwise have permissions to those resources.

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Front-end Proxy Service
- **Description:** Clients upload and download data via a front-end proxy service that performs authentication.
- **Advantages:**
  - Allows validation of business rules.
- **Challenges:**
  - For large amounts of data or high-volume transactions, scaling the service to match demand can be expensive or difficult.
  
### Scenario 2: SAS Provider Service
- **Description:** A lightweight service authenticates the client as needed and then generates a SAS. The client application receives the SAS and accesses storage account resources directly.
- **Advantages:**
  - Reduces the need to route all data through the front-end proxy service.
  - Efficient for high-volume transactions or large data transfers.

### Hybrid Approach
- **Description:** Combines both approaches. Some data is processed and validated via the front-end proxy, while other data is saved and/or read directly using SAS.

## SAS in Copy Operations

- **Copying Blobs:**
  - When copying a blob to another blob in a different storage account, a SAS is required to authorize access to the source blob. Optionally, a SAS can be used for the destination blob.
  
- **Copying Files:**
  - When copying a file to another file in a different storage account, a SAS is required for the source file. Optionally, a SAS can be used for the destination file.
  
- **Cross-Object Type Copying:**
  - When copying a blob to a file or a file to a blob, a SAS is needed to authorize access to the source object, even if the source and destination objects are within the same storage account.

## Summary

- **Use SAS:**
  - When you need to provide secure access to storage resources for clients without direct permissions.
  - In scenarios where clients need to read/write their own data directly.
  - To authorize access in copy operations between different storage accounts or between blobs and files.

- **Considerations:**
  - Evaluate whether to use a front-end proxy, SAS provider service, or a hybrid approach based on your application requirements and data volume.
  - Ensure proper security practices by minimizing SAS expiration times and granting only necessary permissions.

# Explore Stored Access Policies

A stored access policy provides an extra level of control over service-level shared access signatures (SAS) on the server side. It groups SAS and imposes additional restrictions on them. A stored access policy allows you to change the start time, expiry time, or permissions for a signature, or to revoke it after issuance.

## Supported Storage Resources

Stored access policies can be created for:
- Blob containers
- File shares
- Queues
- Tables

## Creating a Stored Access Policy

The access policy for a SAS includes the start time, expiry time, and permissions. These parameters can be specified on the signature URI, within the stored access policy, or as a combination. However, a parameter cannot be specified on both the SAS token and the stored access policy.

To create or modify a stored access policy, use the Set ACL operation for the resource (Set Container ACL, Set Queue ACL, Set Table ACL, Set Share ACL). The request body includes a unique signed identifier (up to 64 characters) and optional parameters of the access policy.

**Note:** It may take up to 30 seconds for a stored access policy to take effect. During this time, requests against a SAS associated with the policy may fail with status code 403 (Forbidden).

### Example: Creating a Stored Access Policy

#### Using C# .NET

```csharp
BlobSignedIdentifier identifier = new BlobSignedIdentifier
{
    Id = "stored access policy identifier",
    AccessPolicy = new BlobAccessPolicy
    {
        ExpiresOn = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.AddHours(1),
        Permissions = "rw"
    }
};

blobContainer.SetAccessPolicy(permissions: new BlobSignedIdentifier[] { identifier });
```

#### Using Azure CLI

```sh
az storage container policy create \
    --name <stored access policy identifier> \
    --container-name <container name> \
    --start <start time UTC datetime> \
    --expiry <expiry time UTC datetime> \
    --permissions <(a)dd, (c)reate, (d)elete, (l)ist, (r)ead, or (w)rite> \
    --account-key <storage account key> \
    --account-name <storage account name>
```

## Modifying or Revoking a Stored Access Policy

### Modifying a Stored Access Policy

To modify the stored access policy, call the access control list operation for the resource type with the new parameters. For example, if the current policy grants read and write permissions, you can modify it to grant only read permissions for future requests.

### Revoking a Stored Access Policy

To revoke a stored access policy:
- Delete the policy.
- Rename the signed identifier.
- Change the expiry time to a past value.

### Example: Revoking a Stored Access Policy

- **Deleting a Policy:** Use the Set ACL operation with an empty request body to remove all access policies.
- **Renaming or Expiring:** Change the signed identifier or set the expiry time to the past.
