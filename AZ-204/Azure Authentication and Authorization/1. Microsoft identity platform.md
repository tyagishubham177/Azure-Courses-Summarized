# Explore the Microsoft Identity Platform

The Microsoft identity platform helps build applications that users and customers can sign into using Microsoft identities or social accounts, providing authorized access to your APIs or Microsoft APIs like Microsoft Graph.

## Components of the Microsoft Identity Platform

- **OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect Authentication Service**
  - Supports multiple identity types:
    - **Work or school accounts:** Provisioned through Microsoft Entra ID
    - **Personal Microsoft accounts:** Skype, Xbox, Outlook.com
    - **Social or local accounts:** Using Azure Active Directory B2C
    - **Customer accounts:** Using Microsoft Entra External ID

- **Open-source Libraries**
  - **Microsoft Authentication Libraries (MSAL)**
  - Support for other standards-compliant libraries

- **Microsoft Identity Platform Endpoint**
  - Compatible with MSAL or any standards-compliant library
  - Implements human-readable scopes per industry standards

- **Application Management Portal**
  - Registration and configuration in the Azure portal
  - Includes other Azure management capabilities

- **Application Configuration API and PowerShell**
  - Programmatic configuration via Microsoft Graph API and PowerShell
  - Automates DevOps tasks

## Developer Benefits

- **Integration of Modern Innovations:**
  - Passwordless authentication
  - Step-up authentication
  - Conditional Access

Applications integrated with the Microsoft identity platform automatically leverage these innovations without needing separate implementation.

# Explore Service Principals

To delegate Identity and Access Management functions to Microsoft Entra ID, an application must be registered with a Microsoft Entra tenant. Registering your application creates an identity configuration that integrates with Microsoft Entra ID.

## Application Registration Options

- **Single Tenant:** Accessible only within your tenant.
- **Multi-tenant:** Accessible across other tenants.

## Application and Service Principal Objects

- **Application Object:**
  - Created when an app is registered.
  - Resides in the application's "home" tenant.
  - Acts as a template to create service principal objects.
  - Describes how tokens are issued, resources accessed, and actions taken.
  - Schema defined by the Microsoft Graph Application entity.

- **Service Principal Object:**
  - Represents the entity needing access in the tenant.
  - Defines access policies and permissions.
  - Essential for authentication and authorization.

## Types of Service Principals

1. **Application Service Principal:**
   - Local representation of a global application object in a tenant.
   - Defines app capabilities, access permissions, and resources.

2. **Managed Identity Service Principal:**
   - Represents a managed identity for app connections.
   - Automatically created when managed identity is enabled.
   - Access and permissions can be granted but not modified directly.

3. **Legacy Service Principal:**
   - Represents legacy apps (pre-app registrations or created through legacy methods).
   - Can have credentials, service principal names, reply URLs, and other properties.
   - No associated app registration.

## Relationship Between Application Objects and Service Principals

- **Application Object:**
  - Global representation for use across all tenants.
  - One-to-one relationship with the software application.
  - Template for creating service principal objects.

- **Service Principal:**
  - Local representation in a specific tenant.
  - Created in each tenant where the app is used.
  - Establishes identity for sign-in and resource access.
  - Single-tenant applications have one service principal.
  - Multi-tenant applications have a service principal in each tenant where consented.

# Discover Permissions and Consent

Applications integrating with the Microsoft identity platform follow an authorization model that controls data access through user and administrator consents.

## Authorization Model

- **OAuth 2.0 Authorization Protocol:** Allows third-party apps to access web-hosted resources on behalf of a user.
  - Each resource has an identifier or application ID URI.
  - Examples:
    - Microsoft Graph: `https://graph.microsoft.com`
    - Microsoft 365 Mail API: `https://outlook.office.com`
    - Azure Key Vault: `https://vault.azure.net`

## Permissions and Scopes

- **Scopes (Permissions):** 
  - Represented as string values.
  - Requested by specifying them in the `scope` query parameter.
  - Example: `https://graph.microsoft.com/Calendars.Read` requests permission to read user calendars in Microsoft Graph.
  
- **Permission Types:**
  - **Delegated Permissions:** Used by apps with a signed-in user. Requires user or admin consent.
  - **App-only Access Permissions:** Used by apps running without a signed-in user (background services). Requires admin consent.

## Consent Types

- **Static User Consent:**
  - All required permissions specified during app configuration in the Azure portal.
  - Users prompted for consent if not previously granted.
  - Allows admin consent for all users in an organization.
  - Challenges: 
    - May discourage users due to long lists of permissions.
    - Requires knowledge of all resources in advance.

- **Incremental and Dynamic User Consent:**
  - Permissions requested incrementally as needed.
  - Only applies to delegated permissions.
  - Users prompted for new permissions as required.
  - Challenges:
    - Admin consent for high-privilege permissions must be predefined in the Azure portal.

- **Admin Consent:**
  - Required for high-privilege permissions.
  - Admins authorize apps to access sensitive data.
  - Ensures controls are in place before granting access.
  - Permissions must be registered in the Azure portal for organization-wide admin consent.

## Requesting Individual User Consent

- **Example Request:**
  ```http
  GET https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?
  client_id=6731de76-14a6-49ae-97bc-6eba6914391e
  &response_type=code
  &redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%2Fmyapp%2F
  &response_mode=query
  &scope=https%3A%2F%2Fgraph.microsoft.com%2Fcalendars.read%20https%3A%2F%2Fgraph.microsoft.com%2Fmail.send
  &state=12345
  ```

- **Scope Parameter:** A space-separated list of requested permissions.
- **Consent Process:**
  - User enters credentials.
  - Microsoft identity platform checks for prior consent.
  - Prompts user if new permissions are requested.

# Discover Conditional Access

The Conditional Access feature in Microsoft Entra ID enhances app security and service protection through various methods.

## Key Features of Conditional Access

- **Multifactor Authentication (MFA):** Adds an extra layer of security by requiring more than one form of verification.
- **Intune Enrolled Devices:** Only allows devices enrolled in Intune to access specific services.
- **User Location and IP Restrictions:** Limits access based on geographic locations and IP ranges.

## Impact on Applications

- **Common Cases:** 
  - Conditional Access typically doesn't alter app behavior or require changes from developers.
  - Apps indirectly or silently requesting a token may need code modifications to handle Conditional Access challenges.

- **Specific Scenarios Requiring Code Changes:**
  - Apps using the on-behalf-of flow.
  - Apps accessing multiple services or resources.
  - Single-page apps using MSAL.js.
  - Web apps calling a resource.

## Handling Conditional Access Policies

- **Policy Application:** 
  - Policies can be applied to the app or a web API accessed by the app.
  - Enterprise customers can apply or remove policies at any time.
  - Apps must handle challenge responses to continue functioning when new policies are applied.

## Conditional Access Examples

1. **Single-Tenant iOS App:**
   - App signs in a user without requesting API access.
   - Conditional Access policy requires multifactor authentication during sign-in.

2. **App Using Middle Tier Service:**
   - Enterprise customer applies policy to downstream API.
   - When user signs in, the app requests access to middle tier and sends the token.
   - Middle tier performs on-behalf-of flow and encounters a claims challenge.
   - Challenge is sent back to the app, which must comply with the Conditional Access policy.
