#Azure Content Delivery Networks

Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a robust solution for delivering high-bandwidth content quickly and efficiently to users worldwide by leveraging a network of strategically located physical nodes. Here's a detailed look at how Azure CDN works and its benefits:

### Key Benefits
1. **Enhanced Performance and User Experience**:
   - Faster content delivery through edge caching.
   - Reduced load times for applications requiring multiple round-trips.

2. **Scalability**:
   - Handles high traffic loads efficiently.
   - Ideal for events like product launches where traffic spikes are common.

3. **Reduced Origin Server Load**:
   - Content served from edge servers reduces origin server traffic.
   - Distributes user requests across multiple edge locations.

### How Azure CDN Works
1. **Request Handling**:
   - A user requests a file using a special domain (e.g., `<endpoint name>.azureedge.net`).
   - DNS routes the request to the nearest Point of Presence (POP).

2. **Edge Server Caching**:
   - If the file isn't in the POP cache, it's fetched from the origin server.
   - The origin server can be Azure Web App, Cloud Service, Storage account, or any public web server.
   - The file is cached at the POP and served to the user.

3. **Subsequent Requests**:
   - Other users requesting the same file are served from the POP cache if the TTL hasn't expired.
   - This ensures faster response times and improved user experience.

### Requirements and Limitations
- **CDN Profiles**:
  - Create at least one CDN profile, a collection of CDN endpoints.
  - Use multiple profiles to organize endpoints by domain, application, etc.
  - Pricing is applied at the profile level.

- **Resource Limits**:
  - Limits on the number of CDN profiles, endpoints, and custom domains per subscription.
  - For detailed limits, refer to [CDN subscription limits](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-in/training/wwl-azure/develop-for-storage-cdns/media/azure-content-delivery-network.png).

### Key Features
- **Dynamic Site Acceleration**: Optimizes delivery of dynamic content.
- **CDN Caching Rules**: Customizable caching behavior.
- **HTTPS Custom Domain Support**: Secure content delivery.
- **Azure Diagnostics Logs**: Monitoring and troubleshooting.
- **File Compression**: Reduces bandwidth usage.
- **Geo-filtering**: Controls content delivery based on geographic location.
