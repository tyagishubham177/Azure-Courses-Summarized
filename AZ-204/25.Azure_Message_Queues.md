# Choosing a Message Queue Solution

### Consider using Service Bus queues
- Receive messages without polling.
- Guaranteed FIFO ordered delivery.
- Automatic duplicate detection.
- Process messages as parallel long-running streams.
- Requires transactional behavior and atomicity.
- Handles messages between 64 KB to 256 KB.

### Consider using Storage queues
- Store over 80 GB of messages.
- Track processing progress for crash recovery.
- Require server-side logs of all transactions.

### Exploring Azure Service Bus

#### Overview
- **Fully managed enterprise integration message broker**
- **Decouples applications and services**
- **Transmits data between different applications/services**

#### Data Formats
- JSON
- XML
- Apache Avro
- Plain Text

#### Common Messaging Scenarios
- **Messaging:** Transfer business data (sales, purchase orders, etc.)
- **Decouple applications:** Improve reliability and scalability
- **Topics and subscriptions:** Enable 1:n relationships
- **Message sessions:** Implement workflows with message ordering/deferral

#### Service Bus Tiers
- **Standard vs Premium:**
  - High throughput vs Variable throughput
  - Predictable performance vs Variable latency
  - Fixed pricing vs Pay-as-you-go pricing
  - Scale workload up/down (Premium only)
  - Message size up to 100 MB (Premium) vs 256 KB (Standard)

#### Advanced Features
- **Message sessions:** FIFO guarantee with ordered handling
- **Autoforwarding:** Chain queues/subscriptions within the same namespace
- **Dead-letter queue (DLQ):** Holds undelivered messages for inspection
- **Scheduled delivery:** Delay message processing
- **Message deferral:** Defer message retrieval
- **Batching:** Delay sending messages for batching
- **Transactions:** Group operations within a transaction scope
- **Filtering and actions:** Define message receipt rules for subscribers
- **Autodelete on idle:** Auto-delete queues after idle intervals
- **Duplicate detection:** Discard duplicate messages
- **Security protocols:** SAS, RBAC, Managed identities
- **Geo-disaster recovery:** Continue data processing during regional downtime
- **Security:** Supports AMQP 1.0 and HTTP/REST protocols

#### Compliance
- **AMQP 1.0:** Open ISO/IEC standard
- **Service Bus Premium:** Compliant with JMS 2.0 API

#### Client Libraries
- Azure Service Bus for .NET
- Azure Service Bus libraries for Java
- Azure Service Bus provider for Java JMS 2.0
- Azure Service Bus Modules for JavaScript and TypeScript
- Azure Service Bus libraries for Python


### Discover Service Bus Queues, Topics, and Subscriptions

#### Queues
- **FIFO Delivery:** First In, First Out message delivery to competing consumers.
- **Single Consumer:** Only one message consumer receives each message.
- **Durable Storage:** Producers and consumers don't need to process messages concurrently.
- **Load-leveling:** Producers and consumers can operate at different rates.
- **Loose Coupling:** Consumers can be upgraded without affecting producers.
- **Creation Methods:** Azure portal, PowerShell, CLI, Resource Manager templates.
- **Receive Modes:**
  - **Receive and delete:** Message marked as consumed when received.
  - **Peek lock:** Two-stage process to ensure message processing.

#### Topics and Subscriptions
- **Publish/Subscribe Pattern:** One-to-many communication.
- **Multiple Recipients:** Each published message is available to all subscriptions.
- **Filter Rules:** Subscriptions can filter messages they want to receive.
- **Virtual Queue:** Subscriptions act as virtual queues receiving copies of topic messages.
- **Creation Methods:** Similar to queues (Azure portal, PowerShell, CLI, Resource Manager templates).

#### Rules and Actions
- **Subscription Filters:** Process messages with specific characteristics differently.
- **Filter Actions:** Modify message properties based on filter expressions.
- **SQL Filter Expression:** Optional expression for filtering messages.

#### Key Concepts
- **FIFO (First In, First Out):** Ensures messages are processed in order.
- **Durable Storage:** Messages are stored until processed.
- **Loose Coupling:** Producers and consumers operate independently.
- **Load-leveling:** Balances varying system loads over time.
- **Virtual Queue:** Subscriptions act as queues for topics.
- **Filter Expressions:** SQL-based filters for message processing.

### Explore Service Bus Message Payloads and Serialization

#### Message Structure
- **Payload:** Binary section; not handled by Service Bus on the service-side.
- **Metadata:** Key-value pair properties describing the payload and handling instructions.
  - **Broker properties:** System-defined for message-level functionality and standardized metadata.
  - **User properties:** Application-defined key-value pairs.

#### Message Routing and Correlation
- **Key Properties:** `To`, `ReplyTo`, `ReplyToSessionId`, `MessageId`, `CorrelationId`, `SessionId`.
  - **Simple request/reply:** Publisher expects a reply from the consumer; uses `ReplyTo` and `CorrelationId`.
  - **Multicast request/reply:** Publisher sends message to a topic; multiple subscribers respond.
  - **Multiplexing:** Uses `SessionId` to route related message streams to specific receivers.
  - **Multiplexed request/reply:** Several publishers share a reply queue; uses `ReplyToSessionId`.

#### Routing Inside and Across Namespaces
- **Inside Namespace:** Uses autoforward chaining and topic subscription rules.
- **Across Namespaces:** Uses Azure LogicApps.
- **To Property:** Reserved for future use; avoid relying on it for routing.

#### Payload Serialization
- **Opaque Binary Block:** Payload in transit or stored is always binary.
- **ContentType Property:** Describes the payload using MIME content-type (e.g., `application/json;charset=utf-8`).
- **.NET Framework Support:** Can create `BrokeredMessage` instances from arbitrary .NET objects.
  - **Legacy SBMP Protocol:** Serializes with default or externally supplied binary serializer.
  - **AMQP Protocol:** Serializes objects into an AMQP graph of `ArrayList` and `IDictionary<string, object>`.

#### Serialization Recommendations
- **Explicit Control:** Applications should explicitly serialize objects into streams before including them in a message.
- **Receiver Side:** Perform reverse operation to deserialize.

#### Summary
- **Metadata:** Key-value pairs for describing and handling the payload.
- **Routing:** Utilize broker properties for routing and correlation.
- **Serialization:** Maintain payload as an opaque binary block; use MIME content-type for description.
