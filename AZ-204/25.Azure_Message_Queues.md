# Choosing a Message Queue Solution

### Consider using Service Bus queues
- Receive messages without polling.
- Guaranteed FIFO ordered delivery.
- Automatic duplicate detection.
- Process messages as parallel long-running streams.
- Requires transactional behavior and atomicity.
- Handles messages between 64 KB to 256 KB.

### Consider using Storage queues
- Store over 80 GB of messages.
- Track processing progress for crash recovery.
- Require server-side logs of all transactions.
