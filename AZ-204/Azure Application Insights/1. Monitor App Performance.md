# Discover Log-Based Metrics in Application Insights

## Overview
Application Insights log-based metrics enable detailed analysis of app health, creation of dashboards, and alert configuration. There are two types of metrics:
- **Log-based metrics**: Translated into Kusto queries.
- **Standard metrics**: Stored as pre-aggregated time series.

## Key Differences

### Log-Based Metrics
- **Details**: More dimensions, superior for data analysis and ad-hoc diagnostics.
- **Usage**: Analyze events, get detailed diagnostic traces, count requests, track user sessions.
- **Collection**: Can be manually sent via SDK or automatically through auto-instrumentation.
- **Performance**: Better for detailed diagnostics but might be impractical for high-volume telemetry applications.
- **Techniques**: Uses sampling and filtering to manage high volumes of telemetry data.

### Pre-Aggregated Metrics
- **Details**: Stored as pre-aggregated time series with key dimensions.
- **Performance**: Faster query times, better for real-time alerting and responsive dashboards.
- **SDK**: Newer SDKs (Application Insights 2.7 SDK or later for .NET) pre-aggregate metrics during collection, maintaining accuracy despite sampling or filtering.
- **Benefits**: Reduced data ingestion, lower cost, unaffected by ingestion sampling.

## Usage and Benefits

### Log-Based Metrics
- **SDK Integration**: Use SDK to send events manually or rely on auto-instrumentation.
- **Visualization**: Use Azure portalâ€™s Application Insights blades for visualizing event-based data.
- **Example**: Exact request counts, user session diagnostics, exception traces.

### Pre-Aggregated Metrics
- **Storage**: Stored as aggregated time series, resulting in less compute power for data retrieval.
- **Real-Time Alerting**: Supports near real-time dimensional alerting.
- **Compatibility**: Works with SDKs that do not implement pre-aggregation, as backend still populates new metrics.
- **Performance**: Faster data retrieval, lower data ingestion volume.

## Important Points
- **Both Metrics Coexist**: Log-based and pre-aggregated metrics are both available.
- **Terminology**: In Application Insights UX, pre-aggregated metrics are called "Standard metrics (preview)" and traditional metrics from events are "Log-based metrics".
- **SDK Version**: Pre-aggregated metrics collection is supported by Application Insights 2.7 SDK or later for .NET.
- **Ingestion Sampling**: Pre-aggregated metrics are unaffected by ingestion sampling, ensuring accuracy regardless of SDK version.

# Instrument an App for Monitoring with Application Insights

## Methods of Instrumentation

### Auto-Instrumentation

- **Support**: The list of supported services changes rapidly; check the [supported services page](#).

### Enabling via Application Insights SDKs
- **Use Cases**:
  - Need custom events and metrics.
  - Require control over telemetry flow.
  - Auto-Instrumentation is unavailable due to language or platform limitations.
- **Implementation**:
  - Install a small instrumentation package in your app.
  - Instrument the web app, background components, and JavaScript within web pages.
  - Applications can be hosted anywhere, not just Azure.
  - Telemetry data is directed to an Application Insights resource using a unique token.

### Supported SDKs
- **.NET and .NET Core**
- **Java**
- **Node.js**
- **JavaScript**
- **Distributed Tracing**: All these SDKs support distributed tracing natively.
- **Manual Tracking**: Any technology can be tracked manually with `TrackDependency` on `TelemetryClient`.

## Enable via OpenCensus
- **Overview**: OpenCensus is an open-source, vendor-agnostic library distribution for metrics collection and distributed tracing.
- **Support**: Enables distributed tracing with popular technologies like Redis, Memcached, or MongoDB.
- **Benefits**: Facilitates the open-source community to integrate distributed tracing.

## Steps to Get Started

1. **Auto-Instrumentation**:
   - Enable the agent and configure it to collect telemetry automatically.

2. **Application Insights SDK**:
   - Install the SDK for your specific technology stack (.NET, Java, Node.js, etc.).
   - Add instrumentation to your application code.
   - Direct telemetry to an Application Insights resource using a unique token.

3. **OpenCensus**:
   - Integrate OpenCensus libraries for distributed tracing and metrics collection.
   - Use OpenCensus to enable tracing for various technologies like Redis, Memcached, etc.

# Setting Up Availability Tests in Application Insights

After deploying your web app or website, you can set up recurring tests to monitor availability and responsiveness. Application Insights sends web requests at regular intervals from different global points, alerting you if the application isn't responding or is too slow.

## Types of Availability Tests

### URL Ping Test (Classic)
- **Purpose**: Validate endpoint response and measure performance.
- **Features**:
  - Set custom success criteria.
  - Parse dependent requests.
  - Allow retries.

### Standard Test (Preview)
- **Purpose**: Single request test similar to URL ping test.
- **Features**:
  - SSL certificate validity check.
  - Proactive lifetime check.
  - Support for HTTP request verbs (GET, HEAD, POST).
  - Custom headers and data.

### Custom TrackAvailability Test
- **Purpose**: Run custom availability tests using the `TrackAvailability()` method.
- **Features**: Suitable for multi-request or authentication test scenarios.
- **Usage**: Long-term supported solution for custom tests.

### Multi-Step Test
- **Note**: Available only through Visual Studio 2019.
- **Usage**: Custom TrackAvailability test is recommended for long-term support.

## Setting Up Tests

### Steps
1. **Choose Test Type**: Select URL Ping Test, Standard Test, or Custom TrackAvailability Test based on your needs.
2. **Configuration**:
   - **URL Ping Test**: Configure success criteria, dependent request parsing, and retries.
   - **Standard Test**: Set up SSL checks, request verbs, headers, and custom data.
   - **Custom TrackAvailability**: Implement custom logic using the TrackAvailability method.
3. **Frequency**: Define the interval for running the tests.
4. **Alerts**: Set up alerts for failures or performance issues.

### Example Scenarios
- **Public Website**: Monitor uptime and responsiveness.
- **REST API**: Ensure the availability of dependent services.
- **Private DNS**: Use custom TrackAvailability tests if public DNS cannot resolve domain names.

## Important Considerations
- **DNS Resolution**: URL Ping Test relies on public DNS infrastructure. Ensure public domain name servers can resolve the domain names. Use custom TrackAvailability tests if using private DNS.
- **Test Limits**: You can create up to 100 availability tests per Application Insights resource.

## Troubleshooting
- **Availability Issues**: Refer to the troubleshooting article for diagnosing issues.
