### Azure Cache for Redis

Azure Cache for Redis provides an in-memory data store based on Redis, enhancing performance and scalability for applications relying on backend data stores. It ensures low-latency and high-throughput data storage.

#### Key Scenarios
- **Data cache**: Uses cache-aside pattern to load data as needed and update cache with changes.
- **Content cache**: Stores static content like headers, footers, banners for quick access.
- **Session store**: Stores user-related data like shopping carts faster than relational databases.
- **Job and message queuing**: Queues tasks for sequential processing by another server.
- **Distributed transactions**: Executes a series of commands as a single atomic operation.

#### Service Tiers

| Tier             | Description                                                                                                      |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Basic**        | OSS Redis cache on a single VM, no SLA, ideal for development/test and noncritical workloads.                    |
| **Standard**     | OSS Redis cache on two VMs in a replicated configuration.                                                        |
| **Premium**      | High-performance OSS Redis cache with higher throughput, lower latency, and better availability.                 |
| **Enterprise**   | High-performance caches with Redis Enterprise software, supporting additional Redis modules and higher availability. |
| **Enterprise Flash** | Large, cost-effective caches with Redis Enterprise software, using nonvolatile memory for reduced per-GB cost.  |

### Configure Azure Cache for Redis

#### Create and Configure an Instance

- **Name**:
  - Must be globally unique within Azure.
  - Length: 1-63 characters.
  - Allowed characters: numbers, letters, '-'.
  - Restrictions: Cannot start/end with '-', no consecutive '-'.

- **Location**:
  - Place cache instance in the same region as your application for optimal performance.

- **Cache Type**:
  - Determines size, performance, and features.
  - Recommendation: Use Standard tier or higher for production.

- **Clustering Support**:
  - Available in Premium, Enterprise, and Enterprise Flash tiers.
  - Specify up to 10 shards.
  - Cost: Original node cost × number of shards.

#### Accessing the Redis Instance

- **Command-Line Tool**:
  - Download for Windows: [Redis command-line tools](https://redis.io/download).
  - Common Commands:
    - `ping`: Returns "PONG".
    - `set [key] [value]`: Sets a key/value. Returns "OK".
    - `get [key]`: Retrieves a value.
    - `exists [key]`: Returns '1' if key exists, '0' otherwise.
    - `type [key]`: Returns value type.
    - `incr [key]`: Increments value by 1. Returns new value.
    - `incrby [key] [amount]`: Increments value by specified amount. Returns new value.
    - `del [key]`: Deletes value.
    - `flushdb`: Deletes all keys and values.

- **Expiration Time (TTL)**:
  - Set using seconds or milliseconds.
  - Resolution: 1 millisecond.
  - Information about expirations is replicated and persisted on disk.

#### Connecting from a Client

- **Required Information**:
  - Host name (e.g., `sportsresults.redis.cache.windows.net`).
  - Port.
  - Access key (primary or secondary).

- **Access Keys**:
  - Treated as confidential.
  - Periodically regenerate keys for security.
