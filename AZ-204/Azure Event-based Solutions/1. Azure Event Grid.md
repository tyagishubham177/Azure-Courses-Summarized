## Key Features
- **Event Delivery**: Delivers events to subscriber destinations such as applications, Azure services, or any endpoint accessible to Event Grid.
- **Event Sources**: Can be applications, SaaS services, and Azure services.
- **Event Handling**: Publishers emit events without concern for handling; subscribers choose events to handle.

## Benefits
- Facilitates the construction of event-based architectures.
- Supports built-in events from Azure services.
- Allows custom events via custom topics.
- Provides filtering, multicasting, and reliable event delivery.

## Concepts in Azure Event Grid

### Events
- Describes an occurrence in the system.
- Includes common information (source, time, identifier) and event-specific details.
- General Availability (GA) SLA covers events up to 64 KB; events up to 1 MB are in preview.

### Event Sources
- The origin of events (e.g., Azure Storage, IoT Hub, custom applications).
- Responsible for sending events to Event Grid.

### Topics
- **Endpoint for Events**: Where sources send events.
- **System Topics**: Built-in topics by Azure services, not visible in the subscription.
- **Custom Topics**: Created by applications or third parties, visible in the subscription.

### Event Subscriptions
- Indicate interest in specific events on a topic.
- Require an endpoint for event handling.
- Allow filtering by event type or subject pattern.
- Can set expiration for temporary subscriptions.

### Event Handlers
- The destination where events are processed.
- Supported types include Azure services and custom webhooks.
- Event Grid ensures delivery with retries until successful processing.

# Discover Event Schemas in Azure Event Grid

Azure Event Grid supports two types of event schemas: **Event Grid event schema** and **Cloud event schema**. 

## Event Grid Event Schema

### Structure
- **Common Properties**: All events have four required string properties.
- **Data Object**: Properties specific to each publisher (e.g., Azure Storage, Azure Event Hubs).

### Event Structure Example
```json
[
  {
    "topic": "string",
    "subject": "string",
    "id": "string",
    "eventType": "string",
    "eventTime": "string",
    "data": {
      "object-unique-to-each-publisher"
    },
    "dataVersion": "string",
    "metadataVersion": "string"
  }
]
```

### Event Properties

| Property        | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                           |
|-----------------|--------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| topic           | string | No       | Full resource path to the event source. Stamped by Event Grid if not included.                        |
| subject         | string | Yes      | Publisher-defined path to the event subject.                                                          |
| eventType       | string | Yes      | Registered event types for the event source.                                                          |
| eventTime       | string | Yes      | Time the event is generated based on the provider's UTC time.                                         |
| id              | string | Yes      | Unique identifier for the event.                                                                      |
| data            | object | No       | Event data specific to the resource provider.                                                         |
| dataVersion     | string | No       | Schema version of the data object. Stamped with an empty value if not included.                       |
| metadataVersion | string | No       | Schema version of the event metadata. Stamped by Event Grid if not included. Must match Event Grid Schema. |

### Publishing Events
- Events sent in arrays, with each array limited to 1 MB.
- Individual events can be up to 1 MB.
- Charges apply in 64 KB increments for events over 64 KB.

### Custom Topics
- Event publishers determine the data object.
- Create meaningful subjects for events to facilitate subscriber filtering.

### Filtering
- Subscribers use the subject to filter and route events.
- Example: `/blobServices/default/containers/<container-name>/blobs/<file>`

## CloudEvents Schema

- An open specification for describing event data.
- Simplifies interoperability across cloud platforms.
- Provides uniform tooling, standard routing, and handling.

### Azure Blob Storage Event Example in CloudEvents Format
```json
{
    "specversion": "1.0",
    "type": "Microsoft.Storage.BlobCreated",
    "source": "/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group}/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/{storage-account}",
    "id": "9aeb0fdf-c01e-0131-0922-9eb54906e209",
    "time": "2019-11-18T15:13:39.4589254Z",
    "subject": "blobServices/default/containers/{storage-container}/blobs/{new-file}",
    "dataschema": "#",
    "data": {
        "api": "PutBlockList",
        "clientRequestId": "4c5dd7fb-2c48-4a27-bb30-5361b5de920a",
        "requestId": "9aeb0fdf-c01e-0131-0922-9eb549000000",
        "eTag": "0x8D76C39E4407333",
        "contentType": "image/png",
        "contentLength": 30699,
        "blobType": "BlockBlob",
        "url": "https://gridtesting.blob.core.windows.net/testcontainer/{new-file}",
        "sequencer": "000000000000000000000000000099240000000000c41c18",
        "storageDiagnostics": {
            "batchId": "681fe319-3006-00a8-0022-9e7cde000000"
        }
    }
}
```

### Content-Type Header
- **CloudEvents Schema**: `"content-type":"application/cloudevents+json; charset=utf-8"`
- **Event Grid Schema**: `"content-type":"application/json; charset=utf-8"`

### Integration
- Event Grid supports both input and output of events in CloudEvents schema.
- Applicable for system events (e.g., Blob Storage, IoT Hub) and custom events.
- Can transform events between CloudEvents and Event Grid schema.

# Explore Event Delivery Durability in Azure Event Grid

## Key Features

- **Durable Delivery**: Ensures at least one delivery attempt per matching subscription.
- **Retry Policy**: Uses a fixed retry schedule and exponential backoff for retries.
- **Dead-Lettering**: Option to store undelivered events in a storage account.

## Event Delivery and Retry

- **Immediate Delivery**: Events delivered one at a time in an array with a single event.
- **No Delivery Order Guarantee**: Events may arrive out of order.

### Retry Schedule

- **Configuration-Related Errors**: No retry; events may be dead-lettered or dropped (e.g., endpoint deleted).
- **Errors That Prevent Retry**:

| Endpoint Type   | Error Codes                                                           |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Azure Resources | 400 Bad Request, 413 Request Entity Too Large, 403 Forbidden          |
| Webhook         | 400 Bad Request, 413 Request Entity Too Large, 403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found, 401 Unauthorized |

- **Other Errors**: Event Grid waits 30 seconds for a response, then queues the message for retry with exponential backoff.

### Customizable Retry Policy

- **Maximum Number of Attempts**: Integer between 1 and 30 (default: 30).
- **Event Time-to-Live (TTL)**: Integer between 1 and 1440 minutes (default: 1440 minutes).

### Example: Setting Retry Policy via Azure CLI

```bash
az eventgrid event-subscription create \
  -g gridResourceGroup \
  --topic-name <topic_name> \
  --name <event_subscription_name> \
  --endpoint <endpoint_URL> \
  --max-delivery-attempts 18
```

## Output Batching

- **Batch Settings**:
  - **Max Events per Batch**: Between 1 and 5,000.
  - **Preferred Batch Size**: Target ceiling in kilobytes.

## Delayed Delivery

- **Delayed Retry**: Delays delivery retries for consistently failing endpoints to protect both the endpoint and Event Grid system.

## Dead-Letter Events

- **Dead-Letter Conditions**:
  - Event exceeds TTL.
  - Retry attempts exceed limit.

- **Configuration**: Requires specifying a storage account when creating an event subscription.

### Example Error Handling

- **400 or 413 Response Codes**: Immediately dead-lettered.
- **Dead-Letter Delay**: 5-minute delay before moving to dead-letter storage.

## Custom Delivery Properties

- **Custom Headers**: Up to 10 headers per event subscription, each up to 4,096 bytes.
- **Supported Destinations**:
  - Webhooks
  - Azure Service Bus topics and queues
  - Azure Event Hubs
  - Relay Hybrid Connections

# Control Access to Events in Azure Event Grid

Azure Event Grid uses Azure Role-Based Access Control (Azure RBAC) to manage user permissions for various operations such as listing event subscriptions, creating new ones, and generating keys.

## Built-in Roles

| Role                              | Description                                          |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Event Grid Subscription Reader    | Allows reading of Event Grid event subscriptions.    |
| Event Grid Subscription Contributor | Allows managing Event Grid event subscription operations. |
| Event Grid Contributor            | Allows creating and managing Event Grid resources.   |
| Event Grid Data Sender            | Allows sending events to Event Grid topics.          |

### Role Details

- **Event Grid Subscription Reader** and **Event Grid Subscription Contributor**: Focused on managing event subscriptions, important for implementing event domains. Do not grant permissions to create topics.
- **Event Grid Contributor**: Allows creation and management of all Event Grid resources.

## Permissions for Event Subscriptions

- **Event Handler Permissions**: If the handler is not a WebHook (e.g., event hub, queue storage), write access to the resource is required.
- **Subscription Permission**: Required Microsoft.EventGrid/EventSubscriptions/Write permission on the event source resource.

### Permissions Based on Topic Type

| Topic Type     | Description                                                                                             |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| System topics  | Permission needed to write a new event subscription at the scope of the resource publishing the event.  |
| Custom topics  | Permission needed to write a new event subscription at the scope of the event grid topic.               |

### Resource Format

- **System Topics**: `/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group-name}/providers/{resource-provider}/{resource-type}/{resource-name}`
- **Custom Topics**: `/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group-name}/providers/Microsoft.EventGrid/topics/{topic-name}`

# Receive Events by Using Webhooks in Azure Event Grid

Webhooks are a popular method to receive events from Azure Event Grid. When a new event is ready, Event Grid sends an HTTP POST request to the configured endpoint with the event in the request body.

## Ownership Verification

Before Event Grid starts delivering events to your Webhook endpoint, it requires you to prove ownership of the endpoint to prevent malicious users from flooding your endpoint with events.

### Automatic Validation

Azure infrastructure automatically handles validation for the following services:
- Azure Logic Apps with Event Grid Connector
- Azure Automation via webhook
- Azure Functions with Event Grid Trigger

## Endpoint Validation with Event Grid Events

If using other types of endpoints, such as an HTTP trigger-based Azure function, your endpoint code must participate in a validation handshake with Event Grid.

### Synchronous Handshake

- At the time of event subscription creation, Event Grid sends a subscription validation event to your endpoint.
- The validation event's data portion includes a `validationCode` property.
- Your application verifies the validation request and returns the `validationCode` in the response synchronously.
- Supported in all Event Grid versions.

### Asynchronous Handshake

- For cases where synchronous response isn't possible, Event Grid supports manual validation starting with version 2018-05-01-preview.
- Event Grid sends a `validationUrl` property in the data portion of the subscription validation event.
- Complete the handshake by performing a GET request to the provided URL within 5 minutes.
- During this period, the provisioning state is `AwaitingManualAction`. If not completed within 5 minutes, the state changes to `Failed`, and the subscription needs to be recreated.

## Validation Process

1. **Receive Subscription Validation Event**:
   - Event Grid sends a POST request to the webhook endpoint with a validation event.
   - Endpoint returns HTTP status code 200 to acknowledge receipt.

2. **Synchronous Validation**:
   - Endpoint extracts `validationCode` from the event data.
   - Endpoint responds with the `validationCode`.

3. **Asynchronous Validation**:
   - If synchronous response isn't possible, the endpoint acknowledges with status code 200.
   - Event Grid provides a `validationUrl`.
   - Perform a GET request to the `validationUrl` within 5 minutes to complete validation.

## Important Notes

- **Commercial Certificates**: Self-signed certificates for validation are not supported. Use certificates signed by a commercial certificate authority (CA).
- **Response Requirements**: Endpoint must return HTTP status code 200 for validation event acceptance.

# Filtering Events in Azure Event Grid

When creating an event subscription, Azure Event Grid provides three filtering options to control which events are sent to your endpoint:

1. **Event Type Filtering**
2. **Subject Filtering**
3. **Advanced Filtering**

## Event Type Filtering

By default, all event types from the event source are sent to the endpoint. You can filter to receive only specific event types.

### Example

To filter for only `Microsoft.Resources.ResourceWriteFailure` and `Microsoft.Resources.ResourceWriteSuccess` event types:

```json
"filter": {
  "includedEventTypes": [
    "Microsoft.Resources.ResourceWriteFailure",
    "Microsoft.Resources.ResourceWriteSuccess"
  ]
}
```

## Subject Filtering

You can filter events by specifying a starting or ending value for the subject.

### Example

To filter events where the subject begins with `/blobServices/default/containers/mycontainer/log` and ends with `.jpg`:

```json
"filter": {
  "subjectBeginsWith": "/blobServices/default/containers/mycontainer/log",
  "subjectEndsWith": ".jpg"
}
```

## Advanced Filtering

Advanced filtering allows you to filter by values in the event data using specific comparison operators.

### Operator Types

- `NumberGreaterThanOrEquals`
- `StringContains`
- (others based on comparison needs)

### Example

To filter events where `Data.Key1` is greater than or equal to 5 and `Subject` contains either `container1` or `container2`:

```json
"filter": {
  "advancedFilters": [
    {
      "operatorType": "NumberGreaterThanOrEquals",
      "key": "Data.Key1",
      "value": 5
    },
    {
      "operatorType": "StringContains",
      "key": "Subject",
      "values": ["container1", "container2"]
    }
  ]
}
```
# Exercise - Route Custom Events to Web Endpoint Using Azure CLI

In this exercise, you will:
1. Enable an Event Grid resource provider.
2. Create a custom topic.
3. Create a message endpoint.
4. Subscribe to a custom topic.
5. Send an event to a custom topic.

## Prerequisites
- An Azure account with an active subscription. Sign up for a free trial at [Azure Free Trial](https://azure.com/free).

## Steps

### 1. Create a Resource Group
Launch the Cloud Shell: [Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com)
Select Bash as the shell.
Run the following commands to create variables:

```bash
let rNum=$RANDOM*$RANDOM
myLocation=<myLocation>
myTopicName="az204-egtopic-${rNum}"
mySiteName="az204-egsite-${rNum}"
mySiteURL="https://${mySiteName}.azurewebsites.net"
```

Create a resource group:

```bash
az group create --name az204-evgrid-rg --location $myLocation
```

### 2. Enable Event Grid Resource Provider
Register the Event Grid resource provider:

```bash
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.EventGrid
```

Check registration status:

```bash
az provider show --namespace Microsoft.EventGrid --query "registrationState"
```

### 3. Create a Custom Topic
Create a custom topic:

```bash
az eventgrid topic create --name $myTopicName \
    --location $myLocation \
    --resource-group az204-evgrid-rg
```

### 4. Create a Message Endpoint
Deploy a prebuilt web app to serve as the message endpoint:

```bash
az deployment group create \
    --resource-group az204-evgrid-rg \
    --template-uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/azure-event-grid-viewer/main/azuredeploy.json" \
    --parameters siteName=$mySiteName hostingPlanName=viewerhost

echo "Your web app URL: ${mySiteURL}"
```

Open the generated URL to ensure the web app is running.

### 5. Subscribe to a Custom Topic
Subscribe to the custom topic:

```bash
endpoint="${mySiteURL}/api/updates"
subId=$(az account show --subscription "" | jq -r '.id')

az eventgrid event-subscription create \
    --source-resource-id "/subscriptions/$subId/resourceGroups/az204-evgrid-rg/providers/Microsoft.EventGrid/topics/$myTopicName" \
    --name az204ViewerSub \
    --endpoint $endpoint
```

### 6. Send an Event to Your Custom Topic
Retrieve the URL and key for the custom topic:

```bash
topicEndpoint=$(az eventgrid topic show --name $myTopicName -g az204-evgrid-rg --query "endpoint" --output tsv)
key=$(az eventgrid topic key list --name $myTopicName -g az204-evgrid-rg --query "key1" --output tsv)
```

Create event data:

```bash
event='[ {"id": "'"$RANDOM"'", "eventType": "recordInserted", "subject": "myapp/vehicles/motorcycles", "eventTime": "'`date +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z`'", "data":{ "make": "Contoso", "model": "Northwind"},"dataVersion": "1.0"} ]'
```

Send the event:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "aeg-sas-key: $key" -d "$event" $topicEndpoint
```

View your web app to see the event.

### 7. Clean Up Resources
Delete the resource group and associated resources when no longer needed:

```bash
az group delete --name az204-evgrid-rg --no-wait
```

## JSON Event Example
```json
{
    "id": "29078",
    "eventType": "recordInserted",
    "subject": "myapp/vehicles/motorcycles",
    "eventTime": "2019-12-02T22:23:03+00:00",
    "data": {
        "make": "Contoso",
        "model": "Northwind"
    },
    "dataVersion": "1.0",
    "metadataVersion": "1",
    "topic": "/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/az204-evgrid-rg/providers/Microsoft.EventGrid/topics/az204-egtopic-589377852"
}
```
