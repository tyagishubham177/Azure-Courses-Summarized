# Azure Event Hubs Key Points

- **Event Hubs**: Front door for an event pipeline, also called *event ingestor* ; decouples event stream production from consumption.

## Key Features

| Feature                    | Description                                                                                                                |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Fully managed PaaS         | Event Hubs is a fully managed PaaS with little configuration/management overhead. Event Hubs for Apache Kafka ecosystems.  |
| Real-time and batch processing | Partitioned consumer model; multiple applications can process the stream concurrently.                                   |
| Capture event data         | Near-real-time data capture in Azure Blob storage or Azure Data Lake Storage.                                               |
| Scalable                   | Auto-inflate scaling options to meet usage needs.                                                                           |
| Rich ecosystem             | Supports Apache Kafka clients (1.0 and later).                                                                              |

## Key Components

- **Event Hubs client**: Primary interface for interacting with the Event Hubs client library.
- **Event Hubs producer**: Client that sends telemetry data, diagnostics, usage logs, etc.
- **Event Hubs consumer**: Client that reads and processes event information; supports aggregation, computation, filtering, distribution, or storage.
- **Partition**: Ordered sequence of events held in Event Hubs; supports parallelism for event consumers.
- **Consumer group**: View of an entire Event Hubs; allows multiple consuming applications to read streams independently.
- **Event receivers**: Entities that read event data from Event Hubs; connect via AMQP 1.0 or Kafka protocol 1.0 and later.
- **Throughput units/processing units**: Prepurchased units controlling the throughput capacity of Event Hubs.

**Description of the Processes in the Diagram**:
- **Event Producers**: Generate events and send them to Event Hubs using HTTPS, AMQP, or Kafka protocols.
- **Azure Event Hubs**: Receives events and stores them in partitions.
- **Partitions**: Organize events in a sequence; each partition is read by specific consumers.
- **Consumer Groups**: Enable multiple consuming applications to read the event stream independently.
- **Event Receivers**: Consume events from partitions within their consumer group.
