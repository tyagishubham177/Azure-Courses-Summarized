## Explore Managed Identities

### Overview
Managed identities simplify the management of secrets, credentials, certificates, and keys used for securing communication between services. They provide an automatically managed identity in Microsoft Entra ID for applications to use when connecting to resources that support Microsoft Entra authentication. 

### Types of Managed Identities

1. **System-assigned Managed Identity:**
   - **Creation:** Enabled directly on an Azure service instance.
   - **Lifecycle:** Tied to the Azure service instance. Automatically deleted when the instance is deleted.
   - **Sharing:** Cannot be shared across multiple resources.

2. **User-assigned Managed Identity:**
   - **Creation:** Created as a standalone Azure resource.
   - **Lifecycle:** Managed independently from the Azure service instances. Must be explicitly deleted.
   - **Sharing:** Can be shared across multiple Azure resources.

### Characteristics of Managed Identities

| Characteristic                      | System-assigned Managed Identity                               | User-assigned Managed Identity                               |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Creation**                        | Created as part of an Azure resource                           | Created as a standalone Azure resource                        |
| **Lifecycle**                       | Shared with the Azure resource. Deleted with the parent resource | Independent lifecycle. Must be explicitly deleted            |
| **Sharing across Azure Resources**  | Cannot be shared, associated with a single resource            | Can be shared, associated with multiple resources            |

### Use Cases for Managed Identities

- **Building Apps:** Use managed identities for Azure App Services to access Azure Storage without managing credentials.
- **Securing Communication:** Automatically manage identities and credentials for secure service communication.

### Supporting Azure Services

## Managed Identities Authentication Flow

### System-assigned Managed Identity with Azure Virtual Machine

1. **Request to Enable Identity:**
   - Azure Resource Manager receives a request to enable the system-assigned managed identity on a virtual machine.

2. **Create Service Principal:**
   - Azure Resource Manager creates a service principal in Microsoft Entra ID for the virtual machine's identity in the trusted tenant.

3. **Configure Identity on VM:**
   - Azure Resource Manager updates the Azure Instance Metadata Service identity endpoint with the service principal client ID and certificate.

4. **Grant Access:**
   - Use the service principal information to grant the virtual machine access to Azure resources.
   - Assign appropriate roles using role-based access control in Microsoft Entra ID.
   - Grant access to Key Vault secrets or keys.

5. **Request Token:**
   - Code running on the VM requests a token from the Azure Instance Metadata service endpoint: `http://169.254.169.254/metadata/identity/oauth2/token`.

6. **Get Access Token:**
   - A call is made to Microsoft Entra ID using the client ID and certificate.
   - Microsoft Entra ID returns a JSON Web Token (JWT) access token.

7. **Access Azure Services:**
   - The code sends the access token to call services that support Microsoft Entra authentication.

### User-assigned Managed Identity with Azure Virtual Machine

1. **Request to Create Identity:**
   - Azure Resource Manager receives a request to create a user-assigned managed identity.

2. **Create Service Principal:**
   - Azure Resource Manager creates a service principal in Microsoft Entra ID for the user-assigned managed identity in the trusted tenant.

3. **Configure Identity on VM:**
   - Azure Resource Manager receives a request to configure the user-assigned managed identity on a virtual machine.
   - Updates the Azure Instance Metadata Service identity endpoint with the user-assigned managed identity service principal client ID and certificate.

4. **Grant Access:**
   - Use the service principal information to grant the identity access to Azure resources.
   - Assign appropriate roles using role-based access control in Microsoft Entra ID.
   - Grant access to Key Vault secrets or keys.

5. **Request Token:**
   - Code running on the VM requests a token from the Azure Instance Metadata service endpoint: `http://169.254.169.254/metadata/identity/oauth2/token`.

6. **Get Access Token:**
   - A call is made to Microsoft Entra ID using the client ID and certificate.
   - Microsoft Entra ID returns a JSON Web Token (JWT) access token.

7. **Access Azure Services:**
   - The code sends the access token to call services that support Microsoft Entra authentication.

## Configure Managed Identities

### Overview
You can configure an Azure virtual machine (VM) with a managed identity during or after its creation. Below are CLI examples showing commands for both system-assigned and user-assigned managed identities.

### System-assigned Managed Identity

#### Prerequisites
- Your account needs the Virtual Machine Contributor role assignment.

#### Enable System-assigned Managed Identity During VM Creation
The following command creates a VM named `myVM` with a system-assigned managed identity:

```bash
az vm create --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name myVM --image win2016datacenter \
    --generate-ssh-keys \
    --assign-identity \
    --role contributor \
    --scope mySubscription \
    --admin-username azureuser \
    --admin-password myPassword12
```

#### Enable System-assigned Managed Identity on an Existing VM
Use the `az vm identity assign` command to assign the identity to an existing VM:

```bash
az vm identity assign -g myResourceGroup -n myVM
```

### User-assigned Managed Identity

#### Prerequisites
- Your account needs the Virtual Machine Contributor and Managed Identity Operator role assignments.

#### Steps to Enable User-assigned Managed Identity
1. **Create the User-assigned Identity**
   ```bash
   az identity create -g myResourceGroup -n myUserAssignedIdentity
   ```

2. **Assign the Identity During VM Creation**
   ```bash
   az vm create \
   --resource-group <RESOURCE GROUP> \
   --name <VM NAME> \
   --image Ubuntu2204 \
   --admin-username <USER NAME> \
   --admin-password <PASSWORD> \
   --assign-identity <USER ASSIGNED IDENTITY NAME> \
   --role <ROLE> \
   --scope <SUBSCRIPTION>
   ```

3. **Assign the Identity to an Existing VM**
   ```bash
   az vm identity assign \
       -g <RESOURCE GROUP> \
       -n <VM NAME> \
       --identities <USER ASSIGNED IDENTITY>
   ```

### Azure SDKs with Managed Identities Support

| Ruby     | Create Azure VM with system-assigned managed identity enabled                 |

## Acquire an Access Token with Managed Identities

### Overview
A client application can request a managed identities for Azure resources app-only access token to access a given resource. The recommended method for this is to use the `DefaultAzureCredential` from the Azure Identity library.

### DefaultAzureCredential

- **Purpose:** Simplifies authentication by trying multiple mechanisms to get a token.
- **Order of Authentication:**
  1. **Environment Variables**
  2. **Managed Identity** (if deployed on an Azure host)
  3. **Visual Studio**
  4. **Azure CLI** (via `az login`)
  5. **Azure PowerShell** (via `Connect-AzAccount`)
  6. **Interactive Browser** (disabled by default)

### Examples

#### Add Azure Identity SDK to Project

```bash
dotnet add package Azure.Identity
```

#### Authenticating with DefaultAzureCredential

**Example:** Authenticating the `SecretClient` from `Azure.Security.KeyVault.Secrets` client library.

```csharp
// Create a secret client using the DefaultAzureCredential
var client = new SecretClient(new Uri("https://myvault.vault.azure.net/"), new DefaultAzureCredential());
```

#### Specifying a User-assigned Managed Identity with DefaultAzureCredential

**Example:** Authenticating a `BlobClient` from `Azure.Storage.Blobs` client library with a user-assigned identity.

```csharp
// When deployed to an Azure host, the default Azure credential will authenticate the specified user-assigned managed identity.
string userAssignedClientId = "<your managed identity client Id>";
var credential = new DefaultAzureCredential(new DefaultAzureCredentialOptions { ManagedIdentityClientId = userAssignedClientId });

var blobClient = new BlobClient(new Uri("https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/myblob"), credential);
```

#### Custom Authentication Flow with ChainedTokenCredential

**Example:** Creating a `ChainedTokenCredential` to authenticate using managed identity, falling back to Azure CLI if managed identity is unavailable.

```csharp
// Authenticate using managed identity if it is available; otherwise use the Azure CLI to authenticate.
var credential = new ChainedTokenCredential(new ManagedIdentityCredential(), new AzureCliCredential());

var eventHubProducerClient = new EventHubProducerClient("myeventhub.eventhubs.windows.net", "myhubpath", credential);
```

### Summary

- **System-assigned Managed Identity:**
  - Created and managed automatically with the Azure service instance.
  - Deleted with the parent instance.
  - Not shareable.

- **User-assigned Managed Identity:**
  - Created as an independent resource.
  - Managed separately and can be shared across multiple resources.
  - Requires explicit deletion.
