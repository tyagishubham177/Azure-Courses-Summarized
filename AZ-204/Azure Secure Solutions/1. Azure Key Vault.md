## Discover Azure Key Vault Best Practices

### Overview
Azure Key Vault is a tool for securely storing and accessing secrets such as API keys, passwords, or certificates. A vault is a logical group of secrets.

### Authentication Methods
1. **Managed Identities for Azure Resources:**
   - Assign an identity to your Azure virtual machine or other resources.
   - Azure automatically rotates the service principal client secret.
   - **Best Practice:** Recommended for managing access without manual secret rotation.

2. **Service Principal and Certificate:**
   - Use a service principal with an associated certificate.
   - **Not Recommended:** Requires manual certificate rotation by the application owner or developer.

3. **Service Principal and Secret:**
   - Use a service principal with a secret.
   - **Not Recommended:** Difficult to automate the rotation of the bootstrap secret.

### Encryption of Data in Transit
- **Transport Layer Security (TLS):**
  - Protects data traveling between Azure Key Vault and clients.
  - Provides strong authentication, message privacy, and integrity.
  - Ensures interoperability, algorithm flexibility, and ease of deployment.

- **Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS):**
  - Protects connections using unique keys.
  - Uses RSA-based 2,048-bit encryption key lengths.
  - Enhances security against data interception and access.

### Best Practices
1. **Use Separate Key Vaults:**
   - Create a vault per application per environment (Development, Pre-Production, Production).
   - Prevents sharing secrets across environments and reduces breach impact.

2. **Control Access:**
   - Secure access by allowing only authorized applications and users.
   - Ensure Key Vault data is protected due to its sensitive and critical nature.

3. **Backup:**
   - Regularly backup your vault, especially on update, delete, or create operations.

4. **Logging:**
   - Enable logging and alerts for monitoring and security purposes.

5. **Recovery Options:**
   - Enable soft-delete and purge protection to guard against forced deletion of secrets.

## Authenticate to Azure Key Vault

### Overview
Authentication with Key Vault is handled via Microsoft Entra ID, which verifies the identity of a security principal.

### Service Principal Acquisition Methods

1. **System-assigned Managed Identity:**
   - Azure manages the application's service principal internally.
   - Automatically authenticates the application with other Azure services.
   - **Recommended Method.**

2. **Application Registration:**
   - Register the application with Microsoft Entra tenant.
   - Creates a second application object for identification across all tenants.
   - Used when managed identity cannot be employed.

### Authenticating to Key Vault in Application Code
- **Key Vault SDK:**
  - Uses Azure Identity client library for seamless authentication across environments.
  - Libraries available for multiple languages:

  | .NET                  | Python                 | Java                  | JavaScript              |
  |-----------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|
  | Azure Identity SDK .NET | Azure Identity SDK Python | Azure Identity SDK Java | Azure Identity SDK JavaScript |

### Authentication with REST
- **Access Tokens:**
  - Access tokens are sent using the HTTP Authorization header.

  ```http
  PUT /keys/MYKEY?api-version=<api_version> HTTP/1.1
  Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
  ```

  - If no token is supplied or is not accepted, an HTTP 401 error is returned with the `WWW-Authenticate` header.

  ```http
  401 Not Authorized
  WWW-Authenticate: Bearer authorization="…", resource="…"
  ```

  - **WWW-Authenticate Header Parameters:**
    - `authorization`: OAuth2 authorization service address for obtaining an access token.
    - `resource`: Resource name (https://vault.azure.net) for the authorization request.

## Exercise: Set and Retrieve a Secret from Azure Key Vault Using Azure CLI

### Prerequisites
- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Sign up for a free trial](https://azure.com/free) if you don't have one.

### Steps

#### 1. Sign in to Azure and Start the Cloud Shell
- Sign in to the Azure portal.
- Open the Cloud Shell by clicking the launch button.
- Select the Bash environment when the shell opens.

#### 2. Create a Key Vault

- **Set Variables:**
  ```bash
  myKeyVault=az204vault-$RANDOM
  myLocation=<myLocation>
  ```

- **Create a Resource Group:**
  ```bash
  az group create --name az204-vault-rg --location $myLocation
  ```

- **Create a Key Vault:**
  ```bash
  az keyvault create --name $myKeyVault --resource-group az204-vault-rg --location $myLocation
  ```

#### 3. Add and Retrieve a Secret

- **Create a Secret:**
  ```bash
  az keyvault secret set --vault-name $myKeyVault --name "ExamplePassword" --value "hVFkk965BuUv"
  ```

- **Retrieve the Secret:**
  ```bash
  az keyvault secret show --name "ExamplePassword" --vault-name $myKeyVault
  ```

- The command returns JSON containing the secret value:
  ```json
  "value": "hVFkk965BuUv"
  ```

#### 4. Clean Up Resources
- **Delete the Resource Group and Associated Key Vault:**
  ```bash
  az group delete --name az204-vault-rg --no-wait
  ```
