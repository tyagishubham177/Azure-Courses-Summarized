# Explore the Azure Blob Storage Lifecycle

Data sets have unique lifecycles, with varying access needs as they age. Azure Blob storage provides different access tiers to store data cost-effectively throughout its lifecycle.

## Access Tiers

### Types of Access Tiers

| Access Tier | Description                                                                                          |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Hot**     | Optimized for data that is accessed frequently.                                                      |
| **Cool**    | Optimized for data that is infrequently accessed and stored for a minimum of 30 days.                |
| **Cold**    | Optimized for data that is infrequently accessed and stored for a minimum of 90 days. Lower storage costs, higher access costs. |
| **Archive** | Optimized for data that is rarely accessed, stored for at least 180 days, with flexible latency (hours). |

### Considerations

- Access tiers can be set on a blob during or after upload.
- Only the hot and cool tiers can be set at the account level.
- The archive tier can only be set at the blob level.
- Cool tier data has lower availability but high durability and similar performance to hot data.
- Archive tier data is stored offline with the lowest storage costs but highest access costs and latency.
- Hot and cool tiers support all redundancy options, whereas the archive tier supports LRS, GRS, and RA-GRS.
- Storage limits are set at the account level, not per access tier.

## Managing the Data Lifecycle

### Lifecycle Management

Azure Blob storage lifecycle management offers a rule-based policy to transition data to appropriate access tiers or delete it at the end of its lifecycle.

#### Lifecycle Management Policy

- **Transition Blobs:** Move data to cooler tiers (hot to cool, hot to archive, cool to archive) for cost optimization.
- **Delete Blobs:** Remove data at the end of its lifecycle.
- **Rule Definition:** Set rules to run once per day at the storage account level.
- **Target Rules:** Apply rules to containers or specific blobs using prefixes as filters.

### Scenario Example

- **Early Lifecycle:** Frequent access (hot storage).
- **After Two Weeks:** Occasional access (cool storage).
- **After One Month:** Rarely accessed (archive storage).

This staged transition optimizes costs by matching storage tiers to data access patterns.

### Premium Block Blob Storage

- **Limitation:** Premium block blob storage accounts cannot tier to hot, cool, or archive using Set Blob Tier or lifecycle management.
- **Data Movement:** Use the Put Block From URL API or AzCopy to move data synchronously to a different account's hot tier.

# Discover Blob Storage Lifecycle Policies

Azure Blob storage lifecycle management uses a rule-based policy defined in a JSON document. Each rule includes a filter set and an action set.

## JSON Structure

```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "name": "rule1",
      "enabled": true,
      "type": "Lifecycle",
      "definition": {...}
    },
    {
      "name": "rule2",
      "type": "Lifecycle",
      "definition": {...}
    }
  ]
}
```

### Policy Parameters

| Parameter Name | Parameter Type | Notes                              |
|----------------|----------------|------------------------------------|
| rules          | Array          | Contains at least one rule, up to 100 rules per policy. |

### Rule Parameters

| Parameter Name | Parameter Type | Notes                                                           | Required |
|----------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| name           | String         | Up to 256 alphanumeric characters, unique within the policy.   | True     |
| enabled        | Boolean        | Optional, default is true.                                      | False    |
| type           | Enum           | Valid type is "Lifecycle".                                      | True     |
| definition     | Object         | Includes filter set and action set.                             | True     |

## Example Rule

This rule applies actions to blobs in `container1` with prefix `foo`.

### Actions

- **Tier to Cool:** 30 days after last modification
- **Tier to Archive:** 90 days after last modification
- **Delete Blob:** 2,555 days (7 years) after last modification
- **Delete Blob Snapshots:** 90 days after creation

```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "name": "ruleFoo",
      "enabled": true,
      "type": "Lifecycle",
      "definition": {
        "filters": {
          "blobTypes": [ "blockBlob" ],
          "prefixMatch": [ "container1/foo" ]
        },
        "actions": {
          "baseBlob": {
            "tierToCool": { "daysAfterModificationGreaterThan": 30 },
            "tierToArchive": { "daysAfterModificationGreaterThan": 90 },
            "delete": { "daysAfterModificationGreaterThan": 2555 }
          },
          "snapshot": {
            "delete": { "daysAfterCreationGreaterThan": 90 }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Rule Filters

Filters limit actions to specific blobs. Multiple filters result in a logical AND.

| Filter Name      | Type  | Is Required |
|------------------|-------|-------------|
| blobTypes        | Array | Yes         |
| prefixMatch      | Array | No          |
| blobIndexMatch   | Array | No          |

## Rule Actions

Actions are applied based on conditions met.

| Action                  | Base Blob             | Snapshot | Version |
|-------------------------|-----------------------|----------|---------|
| tierToCool              | Supported             | Supported| Supported|
| enableAutoTierToHotFromCool | Supported             | Not supported| Not supported|
| tierToArchive           | Supported             | Supported| Supported|
| delete                  | Supported             | Supported| Supported|

### Action Conditions

| Condition                         | Condition Value | Description                                 |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| daysAfterModificationGreaterThan  | Integer         | Age in days for base blob actions           |
| daysAfterCreationGreaterThan      | Integer         | Age in days for blob snapshot actions       |
| daysAfterLastAccessTimeGreaterThan| Integer         | Age in days for current version of a blob   |
| daysAfterLastTierChangeGreaterThan| Integer         | Age in days after last tier change          |

# Implement Blob Storage Lifecycle Policies

You can add, edit, or remove a policy using the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, or REST APIs. Below are the steps for the Azure portal and Azure CLI.

## Azure Portal

### List View

1. **Sign in** to the Azure portal.
2. Select **All resources** and then choose your storage account.
3. Under **Data management**, select **Lifecycle management**.
4. Select the **List view** tab.
5. Select **Add rule** and fill out the **Action set** form fields. For example, move blobs to cool storage if not modified for 30 days.
6. Select **Filter set** to add an optional filter, then **Browse** to specify a container and folder.
7. Select **Review + add** to review the policy settings.
8. Select **Add** to create the new policy.

### Code View

1. **Sign in** to the Azure portal and select your storage account.
2. Under **Data management**, select **Lifecycle management**.
3. Select the **Code view** tab.
4. Enter the JSON policy, such as the example below, to move block blobs beginning with `log` to the cool tier after 30 days of inactivity.

```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "enabled": true,
      "name": "move-to-cool",
      "type": "Lifecycle",
      "definition": {
        "actions": {
          "baseBlob": {
            "tierToCool": {
              "daysAfterModificationGreaterThan": 30
            }
          }
        },
        "filters": {
          "blobTypes": [
            "blockBlob"
          ],
          "prefixMatch": [
            "sample-container/log"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

5. Select **Save** to apply the policy.

## Azure CLI

1. **Create** a JSON file with the lifecycle policy. For example, `policy.json`:

```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "enabled": true,
      "name": "move-to-cool",
      "type": "Lifecycle",
      "definition": {
        "actions": {
          "baseBlob": {
            "tierToCool": {
              "daysAfterModificationGreaterThan": 30
            }
          }
        },
        "filters": {
          "blobTypes": [
            "blockBlob"
          ],
          "prefixMatch": [
            "sample-container/log"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

2. **Run** the following Azure CLI command to create the policy:

```sh
az storage account management-policy create \
    --account-name <storage-account> \
    --policy @policy.json \
    --resource-group <resource-group>
```

# Rehydrate Blob Data from the Archive Tier

## Overview

When a blob is stored in the archive access tier, it is considered offline and cannot be read or modified. To access or modify archived data, the blob must be rehydrated to an online tier (hot or cool). There are two main methods for rehydration:

1. **Copying an Archived Blob to an Online Tier**
2. **Changing a Blob's Access Tier**

## Rehydration Methods

### 1. Copying an Archived Blob to an Online Tier

- **Operation:** Use Copy Blob or Copy Blob from URL.
- **Behavior:** The source blob remains in the archive tier; the copy is placed in the hot or cool tier.
- **Limitations:** Must copy to a new blob name or different container. Cannot overwrite the source blob.

#### Supported Operations

| Blob Copy Destination | Hot Tier Source | Cool Tier Source | Archive Tier Source                  |
|-----------------------|-----------------|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Hot Tier**          | Supported       | Supported        | Supported (within the same account)  |
| **Cool Tier**         | Supported       | Supported        | Supported (within the same account)  |
| **Archive Tier**      | Supported       | Supported        | Unsupported                          |

### 2. Changing a Blob's Access Tier

- **Operation:** Use Set Blob Tier to change the tier to hot or cool.
- **Note:** The request cannot be canceled once initiated, and the blob's access tier remains shown as archived until the process completes.

## Rehydration Priority

Set the priority for the rehydration operation using the `x-ms-rehydrate-priority` header.

### Priority Options

- **Standard Priority:** Processed in the order received, taking up to 15 hours.
- **High Priority:** Prioritized over standard requests, potentially completing in under one hour for objects under 10 GB.

### Checking Priority

- Use **Get Blob Properties** to check the `x-ms-rehydrate-priority` header value (Standard or High).

## Example: JSON for Changing Blob's Tier

```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "enabled": true,
      "name": "rehydrate-to-cool",
      "type": "Lifecycle",
      "definition": {
        "actions": {
          "baseBlob": {
            "tierToCool": {
              "daysAfterModificationGreaterThan": 30
            }
          }
        },
        "filters": {
          "blobTypes": [
            "blockBlob"
          ],
          "prefixMatch": [
            "sample-container/log"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Rehydration Process

1. **Azure CLI Example for Set Blob Tier**

```sh
az storage blob set-tier \
    --account-name <storage-account> \
    --container-name <container-name> \
    --name <blob-name> \
    --tier Cool \
    --rehydrate-priority High
```

## Key Points

- **Multiple Actions:** Apply the least expensive action if multiple actions are defined.
- **Run Conditions:** Based on age tracked by last modified time for base blobs and creation time for snapshots.
- **Premium Block Blob Storage:** Cannot tier to hot, cool, or archive. Use the Put Block From URL API to move data.
- A lifecycle management policy must be read or written in full. Partial updates aren't supported.
- - **Lifecycle Policies:** Changing a blob's tier does not update its last modified time. Ensure lifecycle management policies are considered to prevent automatic tier changes.

## Summary

- Azure Blob storage's lifecycle management enables cost-effective storage by transitioning data through hot, cool, cold, and archive tiers based on access patterns. By setting appropriate policies, you can optimize storage costs while maintaining performance and durability.
- Azure Blob storage lifecycle policies use JSON-defined rules to manage data transition and deletion, optimizing storage costs and performance.
- By using the Azure portal (List view or Code view) or Azure CLI, you can easily implement and manage Blob storage lifecycle policies to optimize storage costs and manage data effectively.
- Rehydrating a blob from the archive tier to an online tier (hot or cool) can be done by copying the blob or changing its tier. Both methods require consideration of rehydration priorities and potential impacts from lifecycle management policies.
