# Discover Azure Blob Storage Resource Types

Azure Blob storage offers three primary types of resources:

1. **Storage Account**
2. **Container**
3. **Blob**

## Storage Account

- Provides a unique namespace in Azure for your data.
- Every object stored has an address that includes the unique account name.
- Example endpoint: `http://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net`

## Containers

- Organizes sets of blobs, similar to a directory in a file system.
- A storage account can have unlimited containers, and a container can store unlimited blobs.
- Naming rules:
  - 3-63 characters long.
  - Starts with a letter or number.
  - Contains only lowercase letters, numbers, and dash (-).
  - No consecutive dash characters.
- Example URI: `https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer`

## Blobs

Azure Storage supports three types of blobs:

| Blob Type    | Description                                                                                  | Example URI                                                           |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Block Blobs**   | Stores text and binary data, made up of blocks of data. Can store up to about 190.7 TiB.     | `https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/myblob`          |
| **Append Blobs**  | Optimized for append operations, ideal for logging data from virtual machines.             | `https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/myblob`          |
| **Page Blobs**    | Stores random access files up to 8 TB, used for virtual hard drive (VHD) files for VMs.     | `https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/myvirtualdirectory/myblob` |

# Explore Azure Storage Security Features

Azure Storage offers a comprehensive set of security features to help developers build secure applications.

## Key Security Features

### Data Encryption

- **Storage Service Encryption (SSE):** Automatically encrypts all data (including metadata) written to Azure Storage.
- **256-bit AES Encryption:** Used for data at rest, compliant with FIPS 140-2.
- **Client-Side Encryption:** Secures data in transit between applications and Azure using HTTPS or SMB 3.0.
- **Azure Disk Encryption:** Encrypts OS and data disks for Azure VMs.

### Authentication and Authorization

- **Microsoft Entra ID and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
  - Assign RBAC roles scoped to the storage account for resource management and data operations.
  - Integrate with Microsoft Entra for blob and queue data operations.

### Delegated Access

- **Shared Access Signature (SAS):** Grants delegated access to data objects.

### Encryption Key Management

| Feature | Microsoft-managed Keys | Customer-managed Keys | Customer-provided Keys |
|---------|-------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|
| **Encryption/Decryption Operations** | Azure | Azure | Azure |
| **Supported Services** | All | Blob storage, Azure Files | Blob storage |
| **Key Storage** | Microsoft key store | Azure Key Vault | Azure Key Vault or any other key store |
| **Key Rotation Responsibility** | Microsoft | Customer | Customer |
| **Key Usage** | Microsoft | Azure portal, Storage Resource Provider REST API, Azure Storage management libraries, PowerShell, CLI | Azure Storage REST API (Blob storage), Azure Storage client libraries |
| **Key Access** | Microsoft only | Microsoft, Customer | Customer only |

## Encryption for Data at Rest

- **Default Encryption:** Enabled for all storage accounts, without extra cost.
- **Consistency:** Encryption applies to all performance tiers and deployment models.
- **Impact:** No effect on Azure Storage performance.

# Discover Static Website Hosting in Azure Storage

Azure Storage allows you to host static websites directly from a storage container named `$web`, ideal for serverless architectures.

## Key Features

- **Serve Static Content:** Host HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and image files.
- **Serverless Architecture:** Integrate with Azure Functions and other PaaS services.
- **Limitations:** No support for headers configuration (use Azure CDN) and no built-in authentication/authorization (use Azure Static Web Apps for these features).

## Enabling Static Website Hosting

1. **Locate Storage Account:** Open the Azure portal and find your storage account.
2. **Enable Static Website:** 
    - Navigate to the **Static website** section.
    - Select **Enabled**.
    - Specify the **Index document name** (e.g., `index.html`).
    - Specify the **Error document path** (e.g., `404.html`).
    - Click **Save**.

## Impact of Setting Access Levels

- **Public Access Levels:**
  - Modifying the public access level of the `$web` container does not affect the primary static website endpoint (`https://contosoblobaccount.z22.web.core.windows.net/index.html`), which remains publicly accessible.
  - It does impact the primary blob service endpoint (`https://contosoblobaccount.blob.core.windows.net/$web/index.html`). Changing access level from private to public will allow public read access.

- **Access Levels and Endpoints:**
  - Changing public access to `Blob` allows anonymous read access for blobs, impacting the primary blob service endpoint but not the static website endpoint.
  - Disabling public access at the storage account level does not affect static websites hosted in that account.

## Custom Domain Mapping

- **Custom Domain:** You can map your static website to a custom domain.
- **HTTP Access:** Direct support in Azure Storage.
- **HTTPS Access:** Requires Azure CDN, as Azure Storage does not natively support HTTPS for custom domains.


## Step-by-Step Configuration Example

1. **Open Azure Portal** and navigate to your storage account.
2. **Select Static Website** in the settings menu.
3. **Enable Static Website** by selecting the **Enabled** option.
4. **Set Index Document Name** (e.g., `index.html`).
5. **Set Error Document Path** (e.g., `404.html`).
6. **Save** your settings.

- **Static Website URL:** `http://mystorageaccount.z22.web.core.windows.net`
- **Blob Service URL:** `https://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/$web/index.html`

| Setting | Value        |
|---------|--------------|
| Enabled | Yes          |
| Index   | `index.html` |
| Error   | `404.html`   |
```

By following these steps, you can efficiently host and manage your static website using Azure Storage.
