# Consistency Levels in Azure Cosmos DB

## Overview
Azure Cosmos DB provides a spectrum of data consistency levels, allowing developers to make granular tradeoffs between high availability and performance. The levels range from the strongest to the weakest, providing different guarantees.

## Consistency Levels

### 1. Strong
- **Guarantee**: Reads return the most recent committed version of an item.
- **Tradeoffs**: Highest consistency, lower availability and performance.

### 2. Bounded Staleness
- **Guarantee**: Reads may lag behind writes by a specified number of versions (K) or time interval (T).
- **Tradeoffs**: Compromise between strong consistency and performance.

### 3. Session
- **Guarantee**: Consistency within a single client session.
- **Tradeoffs**: Optimized for scenarios where a single user or device makes multiple requests.

### 4. Consistent Prefix
- **Guarantee**: Reads never see out-of-order writes.
- **Tradeoffs**: Ensures order without the need for strong consistency.

### 5. Eventual
- **Guarantee**: No ordering guarantees, but eventual consistency is achieved.
- **Tradeoffs**: Highest availability and performance, lowest consistency.

# Choosing the Right Consistency Level in Azure Cosmos DB

## Overview
Each consistency model in Azure Cosmos DB is designed for specific real-world scenarios, providing precise availability and performance tradeoffs, and is backed by comprehensive SLAs. Here’s a guide to help you choose the right consistency level for your needs.

## Configuring Default Consistency Level
- **Default Configuration**: Set at the account level and applies to all databases and containers.
- **Applies To**: All reads and queries by default within the account.
- **Flexibility**: Can be configured at any time.

## Consistency Levels and Their Guarantees

### 1. Strong Consistency
- **Guarantee**: Linearizability; reads return the most recent committed version.
- **Use Case**: Applications requiring the latest data and strong consistency.
- **Example**: Financial transactions, inventory systems.

### 2. Bounded Staleness Consistency
- **Guarantee**: Consistent-prefix; reads lag behind writes by "K" versions or "T" time.
- **Use Case**: Scenarios where some staleness is acceptable, but limits on staleness are required.
- **Example**: Leaderboards, real-time analytics.
- **Configuration**: 
  - **Single Region**: Minimum K = 10 writes or T = 5 seconds.
  - **Multi-Region**: Minimum K = 100,000 writes or T = 300 seconds.

### 3. Session Consistency
- **Guarantee**: Consistent-prefix, monotonic reads/writes, read-your-writes, write-follows-reads within a session.
- **Use Case**: Single user session applications where user data consistency is required.
- **Example**: User profile updates, shopping cart.

### 4. Consistent Prefix Consistency
- **Guarantee**: Updates seen in the order they were written; transaction updates are consistent.
- **Use Case**: Applications requiring ordered updates without the need for strong consistency.
- **Example**: Social media feeds, event sourcing.

### 5. Eventual Consistency
- **Guarantee**: No ordering guarantee; replicas eventually converge.
- **Use Case**: Applications where the latest update is not critical, and high availability and performance are prioritized.
- **Example**: Retweets, likes, non-threaded comments.

## Key Points
- **Unlimited Throughput and Storage**: Containers can have virtually unlimited provisioned throughput and storage.
- **Elastic Scaling**: Containers are elastically scaled by partitioning.
- **Data Management**: After creating an account, manage data by creating databases, containers, and items.
- **Region-Agnostic**: Consistency levels apply regardless of the region, number of regions, or write configuration.
- **Read Consistency**: Applies to single read operations within a partition-key range or logical partition.
- **Granular Tradeoffs**: Each consistency level provides a different balance between availability, performance, and data consistency.

# Request Units (RUs) in Azure Cosmos DB

## Overview
Azure Cosmos DB charges for the throughput you provision and the storage you consume on an hourly basis. The cost of all database operations is normalized and expressed as Request Units (RUs). RUs represent the system resources such as CPU, IOPS, and memory required for database operations.

## Understanding Request Units (RUs)
- **Normalized Cost**: Cost for all database operations is measured in RUs.
- **Point Read Cost**: Fetching a 1-KB item by ID and partition key value costs 1 RU.
- **Uniform Measurement**: All operations (writes, reads, queries) are measured in RUs regardless of the API used.

## Throughput Modes

### 1. Provisioned Throughput Mode
- **Provisioning**: Throughput is provisioned per second in increments of 100 RUs.
- **Scaling**: Increase or decrease RUs in increments or decrements of 100 RUs.
- **Granularity**: Provision throughput at container and database levels.
- **Use Case**: Consistent workloads with predictable throughput requirements.

### 2. Serverless Mode
- **No Provisioning**: No need to provision throughput when creating resources.
- **Billing**: Charged based on the number of RUs consumed by database operations at the end of the billing period.
- **Use Case**: Low-usage or development/test environments with infrequent operations.

### 3. Autoscale Mode
- **Automatic Scaling**: Throughput scales automatically based on usage.
- **No Impact**: Scaling doesn’t affect availability, latency, throughput, or performance.
- **Use Case**: Mission-critical workloads with variable or unpredictable traffic patterns requiring high performance and scale SLAs.
