# Azure App Service

## Overview
Azure App Service is an HTTP-based service for hosting:
- Web applications
- REST APIs
- Mobile back ends

Supports development in various programming languages and frameworks, and runs on both Windows and Linux environments.

## Key Features

### Built-in Auto Scale Support
- **Scale Up/Down:** Adjusts the number of cores or RAM.
- **Scale Out/In:** Modifies the number of machine instances running the app.

### Continuous Integration/Deployment Support
- Integrates with Azure DevOps Services, GitHub, Bitbucket, FTP, or local Git.
- Auto-syncs code and changes with the web app.

### Deployment Slots
- Allows use of separate deployment slots in the Standard App Service Plan or better.
- Each slot is a live app with its own hostname.
- Content and configurations can be swapped between slots.

### App Service on Linux
- Hosts web apps natively on Linux for supported application stacks.
- Runs custom Linux containers (Web App for Containers).
- Supports languages: Node.js, Java (JRE 8 & JRE 11), PHP, Python, .NET, and Ruby.
- Allows deployment with custom containers if the runtime isn't supported by built-in images.

### Supported Languages and Versions
Retrieve the current list of supported languages and versions using:
```bash
az webapp list-runtimes --os-type linux
```

## Limitations
- Not supported on Shared pricing tier.
- Portal shows features that currently work for Linux apps.
- Disk latency for built-in images can be higher and more variable than container filesystem. For heavy read-only access, custom container options may be better.

# Azure App Service Plans

## Overview
An App Service plan defines a set of compute resources for a web app to run on. Multiple apps can share the same plan.

## Key Components
- **Operating System:** Windows or Linux
- **Region:** Geographical location (e.g., West US, East US)
- **Number of VM Instances:** Determines scale-out capability
- **Size of VM Instances:** Small, Medium, Large
- **Pricing Tier:** Defines features and cost

## Pricing Tiers
### Shared Compute
- **Free and Shared:** Base tiers, apps run on the same VM as other customers, limited CPU quotas, no scale-out.

### Dedicated Compute
- **Basic, Standard, Premium, PremiumV2, PremiumV3:** Apps run on dedicated VMs, more VM instances available for scale-out.

### Isolated
- **Isolated, IsolatedV2:** Apps run on dedicated VMs within dedicated Azure Virtual Networks, providing network and compute isolation, maximum scale-out capabilities.

## Key Features and Scaling

### Free and Shared Tiers
- **Shared VM Instances:** Apps receive CPU minutes on shared instances, no scale-out capability.

### Other Tiers (Basic and Above)
- **Dedicated VM Instances:** Apps run on all VM instances configured in the plan, sharing resources.
- **Multiple Apps:** Share the same VM instances.
- **Deployment Slots:** All slots run on the same VM instances.
- **Diagnostics, Backups, WebJobs:** Use CPU cycles and memory on VM instances.

### Scaling
- **Scale Unit:** The App Service plan is the scale unit; all apps scale out together based on settings.
- **Scale Up/Down:** Change pricing tier to adjust resources.
- **Isolate Apps:** Move resource-intensive apps to separate plans for independent scaling and regional resource allocation.

## Best Practices
- **Consolidate Apps:** Save money by sharing a plan, but be mindful of resource capacity and expected load.
- **Isolate Resource-Intensive Apps:** For better performance and control, especially if different regions or independent scaling are needed.

# Deploy to App Service

## Overview
App Service supports both automated and manual deployment methods, catering to the unique requirements of different development teams.

## Deployment Methods

### Automated Deployment
Automated deployment, also known as continuous deployment, helps push out new features and bug fixes quickly with minimal impact on end users. Azure supports automated deployment from several sources:

- **Azure DevOps Services:** 
  - Push code to Azure DevOps Services.
  - Build and test code in the cloud.
  - Generate a release and deploy to Azure Web App.

- **GitHub:**
  - Connect GitHub repository to Azure.
  - Automatic deployment of changes pushed to the production branch.

- **Bitbucket:**
  - Similar to GitHub, supports automated deployment configuration.

### Manual Deployment
Several methods are available for manually pushing code to Azure:

- **Git:**
  - Use the App Service web app's Git URL as a remote repository.
  - Pushing to the remote repository deploys the app.

- **CLI:**
  - `az webapp up` command packages and deploys the app.
  - Can create a new App Service web app if one doesn't exist.

- **Zip Deploy:**
  - Use `curl` or similar HTTP utility to send a ZIP of application files to App Service.

- **FTP/S:**
  - Traditional method using FTP or FTPS to push code to the hosting environment.

## Deployment Slots
- **Use Deployment Slots:** 
  - Available in Standard App Service Plan tier or better.
  - Deploy to a staging environment and swap with production slots.
  - Swap operation warms up necessary worker instances, reducing downtime.

# Authentication and Authorization in Azure App Service

## Overview
Azure App Service provides built-in authentication and authorization support, allowing you to sign in users and access data with minimal or no code.

## Benefits of Built-in Authentication
- **Time-saving:** Reduces effort by offering out-of-the-box solutions.
- **Federated Identity Providers:** Simplifies integration with various login providers (Microsoft Entra ID, Facebook, Google, Twitter).
- **No specific language or SDK required:** Can be integrated regardless of the programming language or security expertise.

## Identity Providers

| Provider                  | Sign-in Endpoint           | How-To Guidance                                |
|---------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Microsoft identity platform | /.auth/login/aad           | [App Service Microsoft identity platform login](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-authentication-overview) |
| Facebook                  | /.auth/login/facebook      | [App Service Facebook login](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-authentication-overview) |
| Google                    | /.auth/login/google        | [App Service Google login](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-authentication-overview) |
| Twitter                   | /.auth/login/twitter       | [App Service Twitter login](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-authentication-overview) |
| Any OpenID Connect provider | /.auth/login/<providerName> | [App Service OpenID Connect login](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-authentication-overview) |
| GitHub                    | /.auth/login/github        | [App Service GitHub login](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-authentication-overview) |

## How it Works
The authentication and authorization module intercepts all incoming HTTP requests to:
- Authenticate users with specified identity providers.
- Validate, store, and refresh OAuth tokens.
- Manage authenticated sessions.
- Inject identity information into HTTP request headers.

### Configuration
- Can be configured using Azure Resource Manager settings or a configuration file.
- No need for SDKs or changes to application code.
- In Linux and containers, it runs in a separate container.

## Authentication Flow

| Step                         | Without Provider SDK                                        | With Provider SDK                                                      |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sign user in                 | Redirects to /.auth/login/<provider>.                       | Client signs in with provider's SDK, receives authentication token.    |
| Post-authentication          | Redirects to /.auth/login/<provider>/callback.              | Client posts token to /.auth/login/<provider> for validation.          |
| Establish authenticated session | Adds authenticated cookie to response.                   | Returns authentication token to client code.                           |
| Serve authenticated content  | Includes authentication cookie in subsequent requests.     | Presents authentication token in X-ZUMO-AUTH header.                   |

## Authorization Behavior

### Options
- **Allow unauthenticated requests:** Defers authorization to application code. Passes authentication information in HTTP headers for authenticated requests.
- **Require authentication:** Rejects unauthenticated traffic. Can redirect to identity provider or return HTTP 401 Unauthorized/403 Forbidden.

### Considerations
- Applies to all calls to the app, which might not be suitable for apps requiring a publicly accessible home page.

## Token Store
- **Built-in Token Store:** Repository of tokens associated with users, available immediately when authentication is enabled.

## Logging and Tracing
- **Application Logging:** Authentication and authorization traces are collected in log files, aiding in debugging unexpected authentication errors.

# App Service Networking Features

## Overview
Apps hosted in Azure App Service are accessible via the internet by default. To control inbound and outbound network traffic, Azure provides several networking features.

## Deployment Types
1. **Multitenant Public Service:**
   - Hosts App Service plans in Free, Shared, Basic, Standard, Premium, PremiumV2, PremiumV3 SKUs.
   - Uses a multi-tenant network.

2. **Single-tenant App Service Environment (ASE):**
   - Hosts Isolated SKU App Service plans.
   - Directly integrated into your Azure virtual network.

## Multitenant App Service Networking Features

### Inbound Features
- **App-assigned address:** Supports IP-based SSL needs and provides unshared dedicated inbound addresses.
- **Access restrictions:** Restricts access to your app from specified IP addresses.
- **Service endpoints:** Allows secure connection to specific Azure services.
- **Private endpoints:** Provides secure, private access to your app.

### Outbound Features
- **Hybrid Connections:** Allows apps to access resources in other networks securely.
- **Gateway-required virtual network integration:** Uses a gateway to connect to a virtual network.
- **Virtual network integration:** Enables apps to connect to resources in a virtual network.

## Default Networking Behavior
- **Free and Shared SKU plans:** Host workloads on multitenant workers.
- **Basic and higher plans:** Host workloads dedicated to one App Service plan. All apps in a Standard plan run on the same worker.
- **Scaling:** Scaling out replicates all apps in the App Service plan on new worker instances.

## Outbound Addresses
- Outbound addresses are determined by the VM family of the App Service plan.
- **PossibleOutboundIpAddresses:** Property listing all potential outbound IP addresses for an app.

## Finding Outbound IP Addresses
### Currently Used Outbound IPs
1. **Azure Portal:**
   - Navigate to your app's properties.

2. **Azure CLI Command:**
   ```bash
   az webapp show \
       --resource-group <group_name> \
       --name <app_name> \
       --query outboundIpAddresses \
       --output tsv
   ```

### All Possible Outbound IPs
1. **Azure CLI Command:**
   ```bash
   az webapp show \
       --resource-group <group_name> \
       --name <app_name> \
       --query possibleOutboundIpAddresses \
       --output tsv
   ```
