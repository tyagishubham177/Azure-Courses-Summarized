# Exploring Staging Environments in Azure App Service

When deploying your web app, web app on Linux, mobile backend, or API app to Azure App Service, you can utilize separate deployment slots instead of the default production slot in Standard, Premium, or Isolated App Service plan tiers.

## Key Points

- **Deployment Slots**:
  - Separate live apps with their own host names.
  - Allow content and configuration swaps between slots, including the production slot.
  
- **Benefits of Non-Production Slots**:
  - **Validation**: Validate app changes in a staging slot before swapping to production.
  - **Seamless Deployment**: Warm up all instances in the slot before swapping, ensuring no downtime.
  - **Rollback**: Easy to revert to the previous state if the changes are not as expected.
  
- **Slot Configuration**:
  - Different App Service plan tiers support a varying number of deployment slots.
  - No extra charge for using deployment slots.
  - Ensure target tier supports the number of slots used when scaling your app.
  - New slots are empty on creation but can clone settings from another slot.

## Tier Support for Deployment Slots

| App Service Plan Tier | Number of Deployment Slots Supported |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Standard              | Up to 5 slots                         |
| Premium               | Varies, more than Standard            |
| Isolated              | Varies, more than Premium             |

# Examining Slot Swapping in Azure App Service

## Key Process Overview

When swapping two slots (e.g., staging to production), Azure App Service ensures minimal downtime for the target slot by following these steps:

1. **Apply Settings to Source Slot**:
   - Slot-specific app settings and connection strings.
   - Continuous deployment settings.
   - App Service authentication settings.
   
2. **Instance Restart and Validation**:
   - Restart all instances in the source slot.
   - Swap with preview allows for validation of settings before completing the swap.

3. **Instance Initialization**:
   - Ensure all instances restart successfully.
   - Initialize local cache (if enabled) via HTTP requests.
   - Trigger application initialization through HTTP requests for custom warm-up (if auto swap enabled).

4. **Final Swap Execution**:
   - Swap routing rules if all instances are warmed up successfully.
   - Ensure target slot remains online throughout the swap process.

# Swap Deployment Slots in Azure App Service

## Key Steps

### Manually Swapping Deployment Slots

1. **Navigate to Deployment Slots**:
   - Go to your app's Deployment slots page.
   - Select `Swap`.

2. **Configure Swap**:
   - Select the source and target slots (usually, the target is the production slot).
   - Verify configuration changes in the `Source Changes` and `Target Changes` tabs.
   - Select `Swap` to execute immediately.

3. **Swap with Preview**:
   - Select `Perform swap with preview` instead of `Swap`.
   - Validate the app's performance in the source slot.
   - Complete the swap or cancel if needed.

### Swap with Preview (Multi-Phase Swap)

1. **Initiate Swap with Preview**:
   - Follow the steps for manual swap but select `Perform swap with preview`.

2. **Start Swap**:
   - Select `Start Swap`.

3. **Validate and Complete**:
   - After phase 1, validate the swap at `https://<app_name>-<source-slot-name>.azurewebsites.net`.
   - Select `Complete Swap` to finish or `Cancel Swap` to revert.

### Configure Auto Swap

1. **Enable Auto Swap**:
   - Go to your app's resource page.
   - Navigate to Configuration > General settings.
   - Enable `Auto swap` and select the target slot.
   - Save the changes.

2. **Deploy with Auto Swap**:
   - Push code changes to the source slot.
   - Auto swap occurs after the source slot warms up.

### Specify Custom Warm-Up

1. **Web.Config Configuration**:
   - Add initialization actions in `web.config`.

    ```xml
    <system.webServer>
        <applicationInitialization>
            <add initializationPage="/" hostName="[app hostname]" />
            <add initializationPage="/Home/About" hostName="[app hostname]" />
        </applicationInitialization>
    </system.webServer>
    ```

2. **App Settings for Custom Warm-Up**:
   - `WEBSITE_SWAP_WARMUP_PING_PATH`: Path to ping for warm-up.
   - `WEBSITE_SWAP_WARMUP_PING_STATUSES`: Valid HTTP response codes.
   - `WEBSITE_WARMUP_PATH`: Path to ping whenever the site restarts.

### Roll Back and Monitor Swap

1. **Roll Back**:
   - If errors occur, swap the slots back to their pre-swap states.

2. **Monitor Swap**:
   - Check the activity log on your app's resource page.
   - Look for `Swap Web App Slots` in the log query to see details.

By following these steps, you can effectively manage slot swapping in Azure App Service to ensure seamless and efficient deployments.

# Route Traffic in Azure App Service

## Key Points

By default, all client requests to the app's production URL are routed to the production slot. You can route a portion of the traffic to another slot for user feedback on new updates without fully releasing to production.

## Automatic Traffic Routing

### Steps to Route Traffic Automatically

1. **Navigate to Deployment Slots**:
   - Go to your app's resource page.
   - Select `Deployment slots`.

2. **Set Traffic Percentage**:
   - In the `Traffic %` column of the desired slot, specify the percentage of traffic (0-100%) to route.
   - Select `Save`.

### Traffic Routing Behavior

- **Session Pinning**: Clients routed to a specific slot are pinned to that slot for the duration of their session.
- **Session Identification**: Use the `x-ms-routing-name` cookie to determine the slot:
  - Staging slot: `x-ms-routing-name=staging`
  - Production slot: `x-ms-routing-name=self`

## Manual Traffic Routing

### Opt-In/Opt-Out Links

- **Opt-Out of Beta App**:
  ```html
  <a href="<webappname>.azurewebsites.net/?x-ms-routing-name=self">Go back to production app</a>
  ```
  - Redirects client to the production slot and sets the session cookie `x-ms-routing-name=self`.

- **Opt-In to Beta App**:
  ```html
  <a href="<webappname>.azurewebsites.net/?x-ms-routing-name=staging">Try the beta version</a>
  ```
  - Redirects client to the staging slot and sets the session cookie `x-ms-routing-name=staging`.

## Considerations

- **Scaling**: Ensure the target tier supports the number of slots your app uses.
- **Deployment**: Deploy from different repository branches or repositories to different slots.
- **Making Settings Swappable**:
  - Use the app setting `WEBSITE_OVERRIDE_PRESERVE_DEFAULT_STICKY_SLOT_SETTINGS` and set its value to `0` or `false` to make all settings swappable.
  - Managed identities are never swapped and are not affected by this setting.

- **Configuration Page**:
  - To make an app setting or connection string stick to a specific slot, go to the Configuration page for that slot and select "Deployment slot setting."

By leveraging deployment slots, you can ensure a smooth, zero-downtime deployment process and quick rollback capabilities.
By understanding and properly configuring slot swapping, you can achieve seamless, zero-downtime deployments in Azure App Service.

### Additional Details

- **Default Routing Rule**:
  - New slots have a default routing rule of 0%, displayed in grey.
  - Explicitly setting the rule to 0% hides the slot from public automatic routing but allows manual access.

## Usage Scenarios

- **User Feedback**: Route a portion of users to a staging slot for feedback on new updates.
- **Internal Testing**: Hide staging slots from the public while allowing internal teams to test changes.

By leveraging these traffic routing features, you can effectively manage user feedback and testing in your Azure App Service deployments.
