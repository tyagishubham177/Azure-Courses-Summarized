## Accessing Application Settings
1. Navigate to your app's management page.
2. Select **Configuration** > **Application Settings**.

## Setting App Settings
- ASP.NET & ASP.NET Core: App Service settings override Web.config or appsettings.json.
- Development settings in Web.config/appsettings.json, production secrets in App Service.
- Encrypted at rest.

## Adding and Editing Settings
- **Add New Setting**: Click **New application setting**.
  - Specify if the setting is swappable for deployment slots.
- **Edit Setting**: Click the **Edit** button.
- After changes, click **Update** and then **Save**.

## Linux Container Specifics
- Replace `:` with `__` in nested JSON key structures (e.g., `ApplicationInsights:InstrumentationKey` becomes `ApplicationInsights__InstrumentationKey`).

## Bulk Editing
- Use **Advanced edit** to add or edit multiple settings.
- Format in JSON:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "<key-1>",
    "value": "<value-1>",
    "slotSetting": false
  },
  {
    "name": "<key-2>",
    "value": "<value-2>",
    "slotSetting": false
  }
]
```

## Connection Strings
- Override Web.config values for ASP.NET.
- Use app settings for other languages for better formatting.
- Encrypted at rest.

### Tip
- Use connection strings to back up certain Azure database types.

### Adding and Editing Connection Strings
- Same principles as app settings.
- Example JSON for bulk editing:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "name-1",
    "value": "conn-string-1",
    "type": "SQLServer",
    "slotSetting": false
  },
  {
    "name": "name-2",
    "value": "conn-string-2",
    "type": "PostgreSQL",
    "slotSetting": false
  }
]
```

   - **Storage container:** For basic configuration, select the container.
   - **Share name:** For advanced configuration, specify the file share name.
   - **Access key:** For advanced configuration, enter the access key.
   - **Mount path:** Absolute path in the container to mount the custom storage.

# Enabling Diagnostic Logging in Azure App Service

## Overview
Azure App Service provides built-in diagnostics to assist with debugging your applications. These diagnostics include different types of logging that help you monitor and troubleshoot your app.

## Types of Logging

| Type                    | Platform       | Location                                 | Description |
|-------------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------|-------------|
| **Application Logging** | Windows, Linux | App Service file system and/or Azure Storage blobs | Logs messages generated by your application code, categorized as Critical, Error, Warning, Info, Debug, and Trace. |
| **Web Server Logging**  | Windows        | App Service file system or Azure Storage blobs | Raw HTTP request data in W3C extended log file format. |
| **Detailed Error Logging** | Windows    | App Service file system                  | Copies of .html error pages sent to the client browser. For security, these should not be sent to clients in production. |
| **Failed Request Tracing** | Windows   | App Service file system                  | Detailed tracing information on failed requests, including IIS component traces. |
| **Deployment Logging**  | Windows, Linux | App Service file system                  | Logs deployment failures automatically with no configurable settings. |

## Enabling Application Logging

### For Windows Apps
1. **Navigate to App Service logs** in the Azure portal.
2. **Select On** for either **Application Logging (Filesystem)** or **Application Logging (Blob)**, or both.
   - **Filesystem:** Temporary debugging, turns off after 12 hours.
   - **Blob:** Long-term logging, requires a blob storage container.
3. **Set the Level of details** included in the log.

| Level       | Included Categories                               |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Disabled    | None                                              |
| Error       | Error, Critical                                   |
| Warning     | Warning, Error, Critical                          |
| Information | Info, Warning, Error, Critical                    |
| Verbose     | Trace, Debug, Info, Warning, Error, Critical (all categories) |

4. **Select Save**.

### For Linux/Container Apps
1. **In App Service logs**, set the **Application logging** option to **File System**.
2. **Set Quota (MB)** and **Retention Period (Days)**.
3. **Select Save**.

## Enabling Web Server Logging
1. **Select Storage** to store logs on blob storage, or **File System** to store logs on the App Service file system.
2. **Set Retention Period (Days)**.
3. **Select Save**.

## Adding Log Messages in Code
### Example: ASP.NET
```csharp
System.Diagnostics.Trace.TraceError("If you're seeing this, something bad happened");
```
- Use `System.Diagnostics.Trace` class for logging.
- ASP.NET Core uses `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.AzureAppServices` logging provider by default.

### Example: Python
- Use the `OpenCensus` package to send logs to the application diagnostics log.

## Streaming Logs
### Azure Portal
- Navigate to your app and select **Log stream**.

### Azure CLI
```bash
az webapp log tail --name appname --resource-group myResourceGroup
```

### Local Console
- Install Azure CLI, sign in to your account, and follow the instructions for Azure CLI.

## Accessing Log Files
- **Azure Storage blobs option:** Use a client tool that works with Azure Storage.
- **App Service file system:** Download the ZIP file in the browser.

### URLs for Downloading Log Files
- **Linux/container apps:** `https://<app-name>.scm.azurewebsites.net/api/logs/docker/zip`
- **Windows apps:** `https://<app-name>.scm.azurewebsites.net/api/dump`

For Linux/container apps, the ZIP file contains logs for both the docker host and the container. For a scaled-out app, it includes logs for each instance. The log files are in the `/home/LogFiles` directory.

By enabling and configuring diagnostic logging, you can effectively monitor and debug your Azure App Service applications.
