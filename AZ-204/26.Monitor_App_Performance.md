## Monitoring Capabilities
- **Metrics and Telemetry Data:**
  - Request rates, response times, and failure rates.
  - Dependency rates, response times, and failure rates.
  - Exceptions (server and browser).
  - Page views and load performance.
  - AJAX calls rates, response times, and failure rates.
  - User and session counts.
  - Performance counters from Windows or Linux servers.
  - Host diagnostics from Docker or Azure.
  - Diagnostic trace logs for event correlation.
  - Custom events and metrics for business tracking.

## Getting Started
- **Telemetry Analysis:** Hosted within Microsoft Azure, free to sign up with a basic pricing plan.
- **Monitoring Methods:**
  - **Run Time:** Instrument web app on the server for deployed applications.
  - **Development Time:** Add to code for customizable telemetry.
  - **Web Pages:** Instrument for page view, AJAX, and client-side telemetry.
  - **Mobile Apps:** Integrate with Visual Studio App Center.
  - **Availability Tests:** Regularly ping website from servers.

# Discover Log-Based Metrics

## Key Points
- **Log-Based Metrics:** Analyzed via Kusto queries from stored events.
- **Standard Metrics:** Pre-aggregated time series for better performance at query time.
- **Namespace Selector:** Switch between log-based and standard metrics in metrics explorer.

## Log-Based Metrics
- **Event Collection:**
  - Manually via SDK or automatically via auto-instrumentation.
  - Stored as logs for analytical and diagnostic purposes.
- **Analytical Value:**
  - Exact count of requests, distinct user calls.
  - Detailed diagnostic traces (exceptions, dependency calls).
- **Challenges:**
  - High telemetry volume may require sampling and filtering.
  - Reduced events lower the accuracy of metrics due to query-time aggregations.

## Pre-Aggregated Metrics
- **Storage:**
  - Stored as pre-aggregated time series with key dimensions.
  - Faster data retrieval, requires less compute power.
- **Advantages:**
  - Near real-time alerting, responsive dashboards.
  - Not affected by sampling or filtering.
- **SDK Requirements:**
  - Application Insights 2.7 SDK or later for .NET pre-aggregates metrics during collection.
  - Older SDKs aggregate events on the backend.

## Important Notes
- **Metric Types:**
  - Log-based metrics: Traditional metrics from events.
  - Standard metrics (preview): New pre-aggregated metrics.
- **Endpoint Pre-Aggregation:**
  - Events pre-aggregated before ingestion sampling.
  - Ensures accuracy regardless of SDK version.

# Instrument an App for Monitoring

## Key Points
- **Methods:** Auto-Instrumentation (preferred) or Application Insights SDK.
- **Auto-Instrumentation:**
  - No developer investment required.
  - Ideal for applications without source code access.
  - Enable and configure the agent for automatic telemetry collection.

## Enabling via Application Insights SDKs
- **When to Use:**
  - Need for custom events and metrics.
  - Require control over telemetry flow.
  - Auto-Instrumentation unavailable due to language or platform limitations.
- **Steps:**
  - Install a small instrumentation package in your app.
  - Instrument web app, background components, and JavaScript within web pages.
  - App doesn't need to be hosted in Azure.
  - Monitors app and directs telemetry to Application Insights using a unique token.
- **Supported SDKs:**
  - .NET, .NET Core, Java, Node.js, JavaScript.
  - Support for distributed tracing natively.

## Enable via OpenCensus
- **Distributed Tracing:**
  - Open source, vendor-agnostic.
  - Provides metrics collection and distributed tracing for services.
  - Supports technologies like Redis, Memcached, MongoDB.
  - Can manually track any technology with a call to `TrackDependency` on `TelemetryClient`.

# Select an Availability Test

## Key Points
- **Purpose:** Monitor availability and responsiveness of web apps or websites.
- **Function:** Sends web requests at regular intervals from global points.
- **Capability:** Alerts if application isn't responding or responds too slowly.
- **Coverage:** Tests any HTTP/HTTPS endpoint accessible from the public internet.
- **Limit:** Up to 100 availability tests per Application Insights resource.

## Types of Availability Tests
| Test Type                   | Description                                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| URL Ping Test (Classic)     | Validates endpoint response, measures performance, allows custom success criteria, dependent request parsing, retries. |
| Standard Test (Preview)     | Single request test, includes SSL validity, HTTP request verb, custom headers, and custom data.                |
| Custom TrackAvailability    | Custom application for running availability tests using `TrackAvailability()` method to send results.         |

## Additional Information
- **Multi-step Test:** Available only through Visual Studio 2019, for multi-request or authentication test scenarios.
- **DNS Dependency:** URL ping test relies on public DNS infrastructure. For private DNS, use custom TrackAvailability tests.

- **Resource:** Visit the troubleshooting article for diagnosing availability issues.

# Troubleshoot App Performance Using Application Map

  - Observed external dependencies (e.g., SQL, Event Hubs).
- **Instances:** Run on any number of server/role/container instances.
- **Instrumentation Keys:** Can be separate or within a single key.

## Application Map Features
