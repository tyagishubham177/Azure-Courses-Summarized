# Discover the Azure Container Registry

## Overview
Azure Container Registry (ACR) integrates with existing container development and deployment pipelines, supporting on-demand or automated builds with triggers like source code commits and base image updates.

## Use Cases
- **Deployment Targets**: Pull images to scalable orchestration systems (Kubernetes, DC/OS, Docker Swarm) and Azure services (AKS, App Service, Batch, Service Fabric).
- **Development Workflow**: Push images to a container registry using tools like Azure Pipelines or Jenkins.
- **Automation**: Configure ACR Tasks to rebuild images when base images update or when code is committed. Create multi-step tasks for parallel automation of building, testing, and patching.

## Azure Container Registry Service Tiers
| Tier      | Description                                                                                                               |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Basic** | Cost-optimized entry point for developers. Same capabilities as Standard and Premium, with lower storage and image throughput. Suitable for lower usage scenarios. |
| **Standard** | Increased storage and throughput compared to Basic. Suitable for most production scenarios.                                                                   |
| **Premium** | Highest storage and concurrent operations. Features include geo-replication, content trust, and private endpoints. Suitable for high-volume scenarios.             |

## Supported Images and Artifacts
- **Images**: Docker-compatible container images (Windows and Linux).
- **Artifacts**: Helm charts, OCI Image Format Specification content.

## Automated Image Builds
- **ACR Tasks**: Streamline building, testing, pushing, and deploying images.
- **Automation**: Configure tasks for automated OS and framework patching and building images on code commits.

# Explore Storage Capabilities

## Overview
Azure Container Registry offers advanced storage features across Basic, Standard, and Premium tiers, including encryption-at-rest and geo-redundancy for data protection.

## Key Features

### Encryption-at-Rest
- **Security**: All container images are encrypted before storage and decrypted on-the-fly when accessed.
- **Automatic**: Encryption is handled automatically by Azure.

### Regional Storage
- **Data Residency**: Data is stored in the region where the registry is created, meeting compliance requirements.
- **Paired Regions**: Except for Brazil South and Southeast Asia, data may also be stored in a paired region within the same geography.
- **Regional Outage**: Data may become unavailable during a regional outage and isn't automatically recovered.

### Geo-Replication
- **Multi-Region Storage**: For better performance and resiliency, enable geo-replication to store registry data in multiple regions.
- **Premium Feature**: Available in the Premium service tier.

### Zone Redundancy
- **Availability Zones**: Premium tier feature that replicates registry data across three separate zones in each enabled region.

### Scalable Storage
- **Flexibility**: Create unlimited repositories, images, layers, or tags up to the registry storage limit.
- **Performance**: High numbers of repositories and tags can impact performance. Regular maintenance by deleting unused resources is recommended.
- **Irrecoverable Deletions**: Deleted repositories, images, and tags cannot be recovered.

# Build and Manage Containers with ACR Tasks

## Overview
ACR Tasks is a suite of features in Azure Container Registry that provides cloud-based container image building and automation for Linux, Windows, and Azure Resource Manager.

## Key Features
- **Automated Builds**: Trigger builds by source code updates, base image updates, or schedules.
- **OS and Framework Patching**: Automate patching for Docker containers.

## Task Scenarios
ACR Tasks supports various scenarios for building and maintaining container images and other artifacts.

### Quick Task
- **Function**: Build and push a single container image to a container registry on-demand without needing a local Docker Engine.
- **Command**: `az acr build` in Azure CLI.

### Automatically Triggered Tasks
- **Triggers**:
  - Source code update
  - Base image update
  - Schedule
- **Command**: `az acr task create` to configure tasks with triggers.

### Multi-Step Task
- **Function**: Build complex workflows involving multiple steps and containers.
- **Configuration**: Defined in a YAML file.
- **Example Workflow**:
  1. Build a web application image.
  2. Run the web application container.
  3. Build a web application test image.
  4. Run the test container to perform tests.
  5. If tests pass, build a Helm chart archive package.
  6. Perform a `helm upgrade` using the new package.

## Image Platforms
- **Default**: Builds images for Linux OS and amd64 architecture.
- **Custom Platform**: Specify with `--platform` tag in OS/architecture format.
  - **Examples**:
    - `--platform Linux/arm`
    - `--platform Linux/arm64/v8`

| OS       | Architecture |
|----------|--------------|
| Linux    | amd64, arm, arm64, 386 |
| Windows  | amd64        |

# Explore Elements of a Dockerfile

## Overview
A Dockerfile is a script containing instructions to build a Docker image. Key elements include the base image, commands to update the OS, software installations, build artifacts, services to expose, and commands to run when the container is launched.

## Example Dockerfile

```Dockerfile
# Use the .NET 6 runtime as a base image
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runtime:6.0

# Set the working directory to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the contents of the published app to the container's /app directory
COPY bin/Release/net6.0/publish/ .

# Expose port 80 to the outside world
EXPOSE 80

# Set the command to run when the container starts
CMD ["dotnet", "MyApp.dll"]
```

### Explanation of Each Line
- `FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runtime:6.0`: Sets the base image to the .NET 6 runtime, required to run .NET 6 applications.
- `WORKDIR /app`: Sets the working directory inside the container to `/app`.
- `COPY bin/Release/net6.0/publish/ .`: Copies the published application files from the host to the container's `/app` directory.
- `EXPOSE 80`: Exposes port 80 to the outside world, typically used for HTTP traffic.
- `CMD ["dotnet", "MyApp.dll"]`: Defines the command to run when the container starts, here it runs the .NET application.

## Creating a Dockerfile
1. **Choose a Base Image**: Select a suitable base image (e.g., `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runtime:6.0` for a .NET application).
2. **Set Working Directory**: Use `WORKDIR` to specify where the application files will be located.
3. **Copy Files**: Use `COPY` to transfer necessary files into the container.
4. **Expose Ports**: Use `EXPOSE` to open specific ports.
5. **Set Start Command**: Use `CMD` to define the command to run the application.
