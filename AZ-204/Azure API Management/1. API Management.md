# Explore API Gateways

## Overview
API gateways are crucial for managing multiple front- and back-end services by handling the routing of requests, applying policies, and collecting telemetry.

### Key Functions of an API Gateway
- Acts as a reverse proxy between clients and services
- Routes requests from clients to services
- Performs cross-cutting tasks such as:
  - Authentication
  - SSL termination
  - Rate limiting

## Benefits of Using an API Gateway
- **Simplifies Client Code:** Clients don't need to manage multiple endpoints or handle failures directly.
- **Decouples Clients from Back-end Services:** Clients are unaware of how services are decomposed, easing maintenance and refactoring.
- **Consolidates Multiple Calls:** A single operation can be handled by the gateway, even if it requires multiple service calls.
- **Centralizes Concerns:** Authentication, SSL, and rate limiting are managed by the gateway.
- **Supports Client-friendly Protocols:** Services don't need to expose protocols like HTTP or WebSocket directly.
- **Enhances Security:** Reduces the attack surface by handling public endpoints through the gateway.

## Types of API Gateways

### 1. Managed Gateway
- **Deployment:** Default in Azure for every API Management instance.
- **Traffic Flow:** All API traffic flows through Azure.
- **Use Case:** Suitable when backends are hosted in Azure or other environments.

### 2. Self-hosted Gateway
- **Deployment:** Optional, containerized version of the managed gateway.
- **Use Case:** Ideal for hybrid and multicloud scenarios, enabling gateway deployment off Azure, in environments where API backends are hosted.
- **Benefits:** Allows managing APIs hosted on-premises and across clouds from a single API Management service in Azure.

## Addressing Potential Problems with Direct Client-Service Communication
- **Complex Client Code:** Gateways handle routing, simplifying client implementations.
- **Client-Backend Coupling:** Gateways abstract the service decomposition from clients.
- **Multiple Service Calls:** Gateways can aggregate calls to multiple services.
- **Security and Performance:** Gateways handle authentication, SSL, and rate limiting.
- **Protocol Flexibility:** Services behind gateways can use different communication protocols.
- **Reduced Attack Surface:** Public endpoints are managed securely by the gateway.

By deploying an API gateway, organizations can streamline the interaction between clients and services, enhancing security, simplifying client logic, and improving overall maintainability.

# Explore API Management Policies

## Overview
Policies in Azure API Management allow publishers to alter API behavior through configuration. They are a collection of statements executed sequentially on the request or response of an API.

### Key Points:
- Policies are applied inside the API gateway.
- Policies can modify both inbound requests and outbound responses.
- Configured using XML documents with specific sections for inbound, backend, outbound, and on-error.

## Policy Configuration

### Structure
A policy is defined using an XML document with sections for different stages of request processing:

```xml
<policies>
  <inbound>
    <!-- statements to be applied to the request -->
  </inbound>
  <backend>
    <!-- statements before forwarding to the backend service -->
  </backend>
  <outbound>
    <!-- statements to be applied to the response -->
  </outbound>
  <on-error>
    <!-- statements if an error occurs -->
  </on-error>
</policies>
```

### Sections:
- **Inbound:** Modifies the incoming request.
- **Backend:** Modifies the request before it reaches the backend.
- **Outbound:** Modifies the response before sending it to the client.
- **On-error:** Handles error conditions.

### Example Policy Definition
An example policy to set a header with user data:

```xml
<policies>
    <inbound>
        <base />
        <set-header name="x-request-context-data" exists-action="override">
            <value>@(context.User.Id)</value>
            <value>@(context.Deployment.Region)</value>
        </set-header>
    </inbound>
</policies>
```

## Policy Expressions
- **Single Statement:** `@(expression)`
- **Multi-Statement Block:** `@{expression}`

Expressions can use the `context` variable and a subset of .NET Framework types.

### Example with Policy Expression
Using `set-header` policy to add user data:

```xml
<policies>
    <inbound>
        <base />
        <set-header name="x-request-context-data" exists-action="override">
            <value>@(context.User.Id)</value>
            <value>@(context.Deployment.Region)</value>
        </set-header>
    </inbound>
</policies>
```

## Policy Scopes
Policies can be applied at different scopes such as global or specific to an API. Combined policy statements use the `base` element to determine order.

### Example of Combined Policies
Combining global and specific API policies:

```xml
<policies>
    <inbound>
        <cross-domain />
        <base />
        <find-and-replace from="xyz" to="abc" />
    </inbound>
</policies>
```

## Filtering Response Content
Filtering response content based on the product associated with the request:

```xml
<policies>
  <inbound>
    <base />
  </inbound>
  <backend>
    <base />
  </backend>
  <outbound>
    <base />
    <choose>
      <when condition="@(context.Response.StatusCode == 200 && context.Product.Name.Equals('Starter'))">
        <set-body>
          @{
            var response = context.Response.Body.As<JObject>();
            foreach (var key in new [] {"minutely", "hourly", "daily", "flags"}) {
              response.Property(key).Remove();
            }
            return response.ToString();
          }
        </set-body>
      </when>
    </choose>
  </outbound>
  <on-error>
    <base />
  </on-error>
</policies>
```

### Key Takeaways:
- Policies provide flexibility to manage and control API traffic.
- They are configured using XML and can include complex logic through policy expressions.
- Policies can be applied at various levels to control behavior globally or specifically per API.

# Advanced API Management Policies

## Overview
Azure API Management offers various policies to manage and modify API behavior efficiently. These policies enable conditional logic, request forwarding, concurrency limits, event logging, response mocking, retries, and response customization.

## Policy Types and Examples

### Control Flow
**Applies policy statements based on Boolean expressions.**

```xml
<choose>
    <when condition="Boolean expression | Boolean constant">
        <!-- Policy statements for true condition -->
    </when>
    <when condition="Boolean expression | Boolean constant">
        <!-- Policy statements for true condition -->
    </when>
    <otherwise>
        <!-- Policy statements if none of the above conditions are true -->
    </otherwise>
</choose>
```

### Forward Request
**Forwards incoming requests to the backend service.**

```xml
<forward-request timeout="time in seconds" follow-redirects="true | false"/>
```

### Limit Concurrency
**Restricts the number of concurrent requests to prevent overload.**

```xml
<limit-concurrency key="expression" max-count="number">
    <!-- Nested policy statements -->
</limit-concurrency>
```

### Log to Event Hub
**Sends logs to an Event Hub for analysis.**

```xml
<log-to-eventhub logger-id="id of the logger entity" partition-id="index" partition-key="value">
  Expression returning a string to be logged
</log-to-eventhub>
```

### Mock Response
**Mocks API responses to return predefined responses to the caller.**

```xml
<mock-response status-code="code" content-type="media type"/>
```

### Retry
**Retries execution of child policies based on specified conditions.**

```xml
<retry
    condition="boolean expression or literal"
    count="number of retry attempts"
    interval="retry interval in seconds"
    max-interval="maximum retry interval in seconds"
    delta="retry interval delta in seconds"
    first-fast-retry="boolean expression or literal">
    <!-- Child policies -->
</retry>
```

### Return Response
**Aborts pipeline execution and returns a specified response.**

```xml
<return-response response-variable-name="existing context variable">
  <set-header/>
  <set-body/>
  <set-status/>
</return-response>
```

## Detailed Policy Descriptions

### Control Flow
- **Usage:** Conditionally apply policies similar to if-then-else.
- **Example:**
  ```xml
  <choose>
      <when condition="@(context.Response.StatusCode == 200)">
          <!-- Policy for successful response -->
      </when>
      <otherwise>
          <!-- Policy for other conditions -->
      </otherwise>
  </choose>
  ```

### Forward Request
- **Usage:** Forwards requests to the backend service, specifying timeout and redirect handling.
- **Example:**
  ```xml
  <forward-request timeout="30" follow-redirects="true"/>
  ```

### Limit Concurrency
- **Usage:** Limits the number of simultaneous executions to prevent overloading services.
- **Example:**
  ```xml
  <limit-concurrency key="@(context.Request.Id)" max-count="5">
      <!-- Nested policies -->
  </limit-concurrency>
  ```

### Log to Event Hub
- **Usage:** Logs request or response data to Azure Event Hub for analysis.
- **Example:**
  ```xml
  <log-to-eventhub logger-id="myLogger" partition-id="1" partition-key="userKey">
    @(context.Request.Url)
  </log-to-eventhub>
  ```

### Mock Response
- **Usage:** Returns a mock response, useful for testing and prototyping.
- **Example:**
  ```xml
  <mock-response status-code="200" content-type="application/json"/>
  ```

### Retry
- **Usage:** Retries policies under specified conditions, useful for handling transient failures.
- **Example:**
  ```xml
  <retry condition="@(context.Response.StatusCode == 500)" count="3" interval="2">
      <!-- Child policies -->
  </retry>
  ```

### Return Response
- **Usage:** Returns a custom response and can modify headers, body, and status.
- **Example:**
  ```xml
  <return-response>
    <set-header name="Content-Type" exists-action="override">
        <value>application/json</value>
    </set-header>
    <set-body>@("{ 'message': 'Service Unavailable' }")</set-body>
    <set-status code="503" reason="Service Unavailable"/>
  </return-response>
  ```

# Secure APIs Using Subscriptions

## Overview
Securing access to APIs published through API Management is commonly done using subscription keys. These keys must be included in HTTP requests to access the APIs.

### Key Points:
- Developers need a valid subscription key to access APIs.
- Calls without a subscription key are rejected by the API Management gateway.
- Subscription keys can be regenerated if compromised.

## Subscriptions and Keys

### Subscription Key
- **Definition:** Unique auto-generated key for accessing APIs.
- **Transmission:** Passed in headers or as query string parameters.

### Subscription Scopes
- **All APIs:** Key applies to every API accessible from the gateway.
- **Single API:** Key applies to a single imported API and all its endpoints.
- **Product:** Collection of APIs with different access rules, usage quotas, and terms of use.

### Managing Subscription Keys
- Each subscription has two keys: primary and secondary.
- Keys can be regenerated to prevent unauthorized access.
- Having two keys allows key rotation without downtime.

## Subscription Workflow
1. **Obtaining Keys:**
   - Developers can get subscriptions without publisher approval.
   - API publishers can also create subscriptions directly.
2. **Enabling Subscriptions:**
   - For products with subscriptions enabled, a key must be supplied in API calls.
3. **Sending Keys Securely:**
   - Keys should be sent securely, e.g., in an encrypted message.

## Calling an API with the Subscription Key

### Default Methods
- **Header:** `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key`
- **Query String:** `subscription-key`

### Example Usage

#### Using Header
```bash
curl --header "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: <key string>" https://<apim gateway>.azure-api.net/api/path
```

#### Using Query String
```bash
curl https://<apim gateway>.azure-api.net/api/path?subscription-key=<key string>
```

### Testing API Calls
- Use the developer portal or command-line tools (e.g., curl) to test API calls.

## Additional Security Mechanisms
API Management also supports:
- **OAuth2.0**
- **Client Certificates**
- **IP Allow Listing**

By securing APIs with subscriptions, developers can ensure that only authorized users have access to their APIs, maintaining control over API usage and enhancing security.

# Secure APIs Using Certificates

## Overview
Certificates provide Transport Layer Security (TLS) mutual authentication between clients and the API gateway. The API Management gateway can be configured to allow only requests with certificates containing specific properties like thumbprint, CA, subject, and expiration date.

## Transport Layer Security Client Authentication

### Key Properties for Certificate Inspection:
- **Certificate Authority (CA):** Only allow certificates signed by a trusted CA.
- **Thumbprint:** Allow certificates containing a specified thumbprint.
- **Subject:** Only allow certificates with a specified subject.
- **Expiration Date:** Only allow certificates that have not expired.

### Verifying Certificates:
1. **Trusted Certificate Authority:** Configure trusted CAs in the Azure portal.
2. **Self-Signed Certificates:** Verify certificates directly from the partner, ensuring authenticity.

## Configuring Client Certificates in API Management

### Consumption Tier
- **Note:** In the Consumption tier, client certificates must be explicitly enabled on the Custom domains page.

### Certificate Authorization Policies
Create inbound policies to enforce certificate requirements:

### Checking Certificate Thumbprint
Example policy to check the thumbprint of the client certificate:

```xml
<choose>
    <when condition="@(context.Request.Certificate == null || context.Request.Certificate.Thumbprint != 'desired-thumbprint')" >
        <return-response>
            <set-status code="403" reason="Invalid client certificate" />
        </return-response>
    </when>
</choose>
```

### Checking Thumbprint Against Uploaded Certificates
Upload client certificates to the API Management resource and verify:

```xml
<choose>
    <when condition="@(context.Request.Certificate == null || !context.Request.Certificate.Verify() || !context.Deployment.Certificates.Any(c => c.Value.Thumbprint == context.Request.Certificate.Thumbprint))" >
        <return-response>
            <set-status code="403" reason="Invalid client certificate" />
        </return-response>
    </when>
</choose>
```

### Checking Issuer and Subject of a Client Certificate
Example policy to check the issuer and subject of the certificate:

```xml
<choose>
    <when condition="@(context.Request.Certificate == null || context.Request.Certificate.Issuer != 'trusted-issuer' || context.Request.Certificate.SubjectName.Name != 'expected-subject-name')" >
        <return-response>
            <set-status code="403" reason="Invalid client certificate" />
        </return-response>
    </when>
</choose>
```

## Summary
Using certificates for TLS mutual authentication enhances the security of your APIs by ensuring only authorized clients can access them. By configuring inbound policies, you can enforce strict validation of certificates based on thumbprint, issuer, subject, and other properties, ensuring robust security for your API endpoints.
