# Azure Functions Hosting Options

## Overview
Azure Functions offers three primary hosting plans: Consumption, Premium, and Dedicated (App Service). Each plan provides different scaling behaviors, resources, and functionalities. Additionally, there are two specialized hosting options: App Service Environment (ASE) and Kubernetes.

## Hosting Plans

### Comparison of Hosting Plans

| Plan               | Benefits                                                                                                                                                              |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Consumption**    | Default plan. Auto-scales. Pay only for compute resources when functions are running. Instances are dynamically added/removed based on incoming events.               |
| **Premium**        | Auto-scales with pre-warmed workers. No delay after idle. Runs on more powerful instances. Supports Virtual Network connectivity.                                      |
| **Dedicated**      | Runs functions within an App Service plan at regular rates. Best for long-running scenarios where Durable Functions can't be used.                                     |

### Specialized Hosting Options

| Option           | Details                                                                                                                                                      |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **ASE**          | App Service Environment (ASE) provides a fully isolated and dedicated environment for securely running App Service apps at high scale.                        |
| **Kubernetes**   | Provides a fully isolated and dedicated environment running on the Kubernetes platform, supporting event-driven autoscale for Kubernetes clusters using KEDA. |

## Scaling Behaviors

| Plan               | Scale Out                                              | Max # Instances                                |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Consumption**    | Event-driven. Auto-scales based on incoming trigger events. | Windows: 200, Linux: 100                      |
| **Premium**        | Event-driven. Auto-scales based on events.              | Windows: 100, Linux: 20-100                    |
| **Dedicated**      | Manual/autoscale.                                       | 10-20                                          |
| **ASE**            | Manual/autoscale.                                       | 100                                            |
| **Kubernetes**     | Event-driven autoscale for Kubernetes clusters using KEDA. | Varies by cluster                              |

## Function App Timeout Duration

| Plan               | Default (minutes) | Maximum (minutes)  |
|--------------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| **Consumption**    | 5                 | 10                 |
| **Premium**        | 30                | Unlimited          |
| **Dedicated**      | 30                | Unlimited          |

## Storage Account Requirements
- A general Azure Storage account is required for all plans, supporting Azure Blob, Queue, Files, and Table storage.
- Functions rely on Azure Storage for managing triggers and logging executions.
- Use a separate storage account for storage-intensive operations.

# Scaling Azure Functions

## Overview
Azure Functions scale CPU and memory resources by adding instances of the Functions host. The scaling behavior depends on the number of events triggering functions.

### Key Points
- **Consumption Plan**: Each instance is limited to 1.5 GB of memory and one CPU.
- **Premium Plan**: Plan size determines available memory and CPU.
- **Function App**: The entire function app scales as a single unit.

## Runtime Scaling
- **Scale Controller**: Monitors event rates and adjusts instances.
  - Uses heuristics for each trigger type (e.g., queue length for Azure Queue storage).
- **Scale Out**: Allocates more resources for multiple instances.
- **Scale In**: Reduces instances as compute demand decreases, potentially to zero (cold start).

## Scaling Behaviors

| Factor                | Behavior                                                                                   |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Maximum Instances** | Function app scales out to a max of 200 instances. Multiple messages/requests per instance.|
| **New Instance Rate** | HTTP triggers: new instances once per second. Non-HTTP triggers: new instances every 30 secs.|
| **Limit Scale-Out**   | Can set a limit on max instances using `functionAppScaleLimit`.                             |

## Scaling Limits

| Plan                | Maximum Instances  |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| **Consumption**     | 200                |
| **Premium**         | 100                |


# Summary

## Conclusion
- **Azure Functions** offers more developer productivity, programming language options, development environments, service integration, and cost-effective pricing compared to Azure App Service WebJobs.
- Suitable for most scenarios due to its extensive features and flexibility.
- Understanding the scaling behaviors and limitations of Azure Functions helps in optimizing performance and managing resources efficiently for various application scenarios.
  
## Key Takeaways
- **Consumption Plan**: Ideal for cost-efficiency and dynamic scaling.
- **Premium Plan**: Best for performance, instant readiness, and virtual network support.
- **Dedicated Plan**: Suitable for long-running functions with manual/autoscale needs.
- **ASE & Kubernetes**: Provide highest control and isolation for running function apps.

## Storage
- **Azure Files Shares**: Function code files stored here. Deleting the main storage account deletes function code files irrecoverably.

## Important Notes
- **Cold Start**: Added latency when scaling from zero to one after idling.
- **functionAppScaleLimit**: Allows setting a maximum instance limit for an app to avoid overloading downstream components.

## Practical Considerations
- **Function App Instances**: Share resources within an instance and scale simultaneously.
- **Scaling Control**: Function apps can independently scale within the same plan.
- **Resource Management**: Plan size affects resource availability and scaling behavior.
