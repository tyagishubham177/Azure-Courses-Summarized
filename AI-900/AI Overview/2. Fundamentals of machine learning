# Machine Learning Overview

**Definition:**
- Originates in statistics and mathematical modeling of data.
- Uses past observations to predict unknown outcomes or values.

**Examples:**
- **Ice Cream Sales Prediction:**
  - Combines historical sales and weather records to predict daily sales.
- **Medical Diagnosis:**
  - Uses clinical data to predict diabetes risk based on patient measurements.
- **Penguin Species Identification:**
  - Automates identification based on physical attributes.

**Function of Machine Learning:**
- Based on mathematics and statistics.
- A machine learning model encapsulates a function to calculate output values from input values.
- The process of defining the function is called training; predicting new values is called inferencing.

**Training and Inferencing:**

**Training Phase:**
- Uses past observations with known features (x) and labels (y).
- Features (x) are inputs, and the label (y) is the predicted value.
- Example features:
  - Ice cream sales: Weather measurements (temperature, rainfall).
  - Medical: Patient's clinical measurements (weight, blood glucose).
  - Antarctic research: Penguin physical attributes (flipper length, bill width).

**Inferencing Phase:**
- After training, the model can predict labels for new input features.
- The trained model applies the function \( f \) to input values \( x \) to calculate \( y \).
- The output is often denoted as \( \hat{y} \) (y-hat) to indicate it's a prediction.

**Mathematical Representation:**
- The relationship between features and labels is encapsulated in the function:
  \[
  y = f(x)
  \]

## Supervised Machine Learning
**Definition:**
- Uses training data with known feature values and label values.
- Determines the relationship between features and labels to predict unknown labels.

**Types:**
- **Regression:** Predicts numeric values.
  - Examples:
    - Ice cream sales prediction based on weather.
    - Property price prediction based on size and location.
    - Car fuel efficiency prediction based on engine size and dimensions.

- **Classification:** Predicts categorization or class.
  - **Binary Classification:** Predicts one of two mutually exclusive outcomes.
    - Examples:
      - Diabetes risk prediction based on clinical metrics.
      - Loan default prediction based on income and credit history.
      - Marketing response prediction based on demographics and past purchases.
  - **Multiclass Classification:** Predicts one of multiple possible classes.
    - Examples:
      - Penguin species identification (Adelie, Gentoo, Chinstrap).
      - Movie genre classification (comedy, horror, romance, etc.).
    - **Multilabel Classification:** Predicts multiple valid labels for a single observation (e.g., a movie being both science fiction and comedy).

## Unsupervised Machine Learning
**Definition:**
- Uses data with only feature values and no known labels.
- Identifies relationships between features.

**Type:**
- **Clustering:** Groups observations based on feature similarities.
  - Examples:
    - Grouping flowers based on size and petal count.
    - Identifying similar customer groups based on demographics and behavior.
  - Used to determine the set of classes before training a classification model.
