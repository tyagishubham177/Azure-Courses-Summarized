# Azure Physical Infrastructure

## Core Architectural Components
Azure's core architecture is divided into physical infrastructure and management infrastructure.

## Physical Infrastructure

### Datacenters
- Facilities with resources arranged in racks.
- Equipped with dedicated power, cooling, and networking.
- Globally distributed but not directly accessible.
- Grouped into Azure Regions and Availability Zones.

### Regions
- **Definition**: Geographical area containing one or more datacenters.
- **Function**: Ensures low-latency network connections and balanced workloads.
- **Deployment**: Resources deployed based on selected regions.
- **Special Features**: Some services/features are region-specific.

### Availability Zones

- **Definition**: Physically separate datacenters within a region.
- **Setup**: Independent power, cooling, and networking.
- **Resiliency**: Isolation boundaries to ensure continuity.
- **Connection**: High-speed, private fiber-optic networks.
- **Usage**: For VMs, managed disks, load balancers, SQL databases.


### Region Pairs

- **Definition**: Paired regions within the same geography, 300 miles apart.
- **Resiliency**: Reduces the likelihood of interruptions from regional events.
- **Examples**: West US and East US, South-East Asia and East Asia.
- **Advantages**:
  - Prioritized restoration during outages.
  - Staggered updates to minimize downtime.
  - Data residency within the same geography (except Brazil South).

### Sovereign Regions
- **Definition**: Isolated instances of Azure for compliance or legal purposes.
- **Examples**:
  - **US Government**: US DoD Central, US Gov Virginia, US Gov Iowa.
  - **China**: China East, China North (partnership with 21Vianet).

# Azure Management Infrastructure

Azure management infrastructure includes resources, resource groups, subscriptions, and management groups. Understanding this hierarchical organization helps in planning and managing projects within Azure effectively.

## Azure Resources and Resource Groups

### Resources
- **Definition**: Basic building blocks of Azure (e.g., VMs, databases, networks).
- **Management**: Provision, deploy, and manage individually.

### Resource Groups
- **Definition**: Logical groupings of resources.
- **Characteristics**:
  - A resource can only belong to one resource group at a time.
  - Resources can be moved between groups but will lose association with the former group.
  - Resource groups cannot be nested.

### Benefits
- **Convenient Management**: Apply actions to all resources within a group.
- **Access Control**: Grant or deny access at the group level.
- **Deprovisioning**: Easily delete all associated resources by deleting the group.
- **Organizational Flexibility**: Group resources based on project, function, or access needs.

## Azure Subscriptions

### Definition
- **Management Unit**: For organizing resource groups, managing billing, and scaling.
- **Link**: Connected to an Azure account (identity in Microsoft Entra ID).

### Characteristics
- **Multiple Subscriptions**: An account can have multiple subscriptions for different needs.
- **Boundaries**:
  - **Billing Boundary**: Separate billing reports and invoices.
  - **Access Control Boundary**: Apply different access-management policies.

### Use Cases
- **Environments**: Separate subscriptions for development, testing, and production.
- **Organizational Structures**: Reflect different departmental needs and access levels.
- **Billing**: Manage and track costs by creating distinct subscriptions.

## Azure Management Groups

### Definition
- **Scope Level**: Above subscriptions for managing access, policies, and compliance.
- **Organization**: Group subscriptions into containers called management groups.

### Benefits
- **Inherited Governance**: Conditions applied to management groups are inherited by all contained subscriptions and resources.
- **Large-Scale Management**: Suitable for enterprises with multiple applications and teams.

### Use Cases
- **Policy Application**: Create hierarchies to apply policies (e.g., limit VM locations).
- **User Access**: Provide access to multiple subscriptions through a single Azure RBAC assignment at the management group level.

### Important Facts
- **Scalability**: Supports up to 10,000 management groups in a single directory.
- **Hierarchy Depth**: Can support up to six levels of depth, excluding the root and subscription levels.
- **Parent Support**: Each management group and subscription can only have one parent.
