# Azure Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)

## Overview
A Virtual Private Network (VPN) uses an encrypted tunnel within another network to securely connect two or more trusted private networks over an untrusted network, typically the public internet. This ensures that traffic is encrypted and protected from eavesdropping or other attacks, allowing for the safe sharing of sensitive information.

## VPN Gateways

### Definition
A VPN gateway is a type of virtual network gateway that facilitates various types of network connectivity, enabling secure data transfer across the internet.

### Connectivity Options
- **Site-to-Site (S2S) Connection:** Connects on-premises datacenters to Azure virtual networks.
- **Point-to-Site (P2S) Connection:** Connects individual devices to Azure virtual networks.
- **Network-to-Network Connection:** Connects different virtual networks.

### Encryption
All data transferred through the VPN gateway is encrypted, ensuring secure communication.

### Deployment
- Only one VPN gateway can be deployed per virtual network.
- A single gateway can connect to multiple locations, including other virtual networks or on-premises datacenters.

## Types of VPN Gateways

### Policy-Based VPN
- **Function:** Statically specifies the IP addresses for encryption.
- **Mechanism:** Evaluates each data packet against a predefined set of IP addresses to determine the tunnel for the packet.
  
### Route-Based VPN
- **Function:** Models IPSec tunnels as network interfaces or virtual tunnel interfaces.
- **Mechanism:** Uses IP routing (static routes or dynamic routing protocols) to determine the tunnel interface for each packet.
- **Preferred For:** 
  - Virtual network connections
  - Point-to-site connections
  - Multisite connections
  - Coexistence with Azure ExpressRoute
  - High-availability scenarios

## High Availability and Fault Tolerance

### Active/Standby Configuration

### Active/Active Configuration
- **Setup:** Uses BGP routing protocol with unique public IPs for each instance.
- **Benefit:** Creates separate tunnels for enhanced availability and resiliency.

### ExpressRoute Failover
- **Purpose:** Provides a secure failover path for ExpressRoute connections using the internet.
- **Benefit:** Ensures continuous connectivity even if the ExpressRoute circuit faces an outage.

### Zone-Redundant Gateways
- **Deployment:** In regions supporting availability zones, gateways can be configured for zone redundancy.
- **Benefit:** Offers resiliency, scalability, and higher availability by physically and logically separating gateways within a region.
- **Requirements:** Different gateway SKUs and Standard public IP addresses.

# Azure ExpressRoute

## Overview
Azure ExpressRoute enables you to extend your on-premises networks into the Microsoft cloud via a private connection, facilitated by a connectivity provider. This connection, known as an ExpressRoute Circuit, allows for secure, high-performance access to Microsoft cloud services, including Microsoft Azure and Microsoft 365.

# Azure DNS

## Overview
Azure DNS is a hosting service for DNS domains that provides name resolution using Microsoft Azure infrastructure. It allows you to manage your DNS records with the same credentials, APIs, tools, and billing as your other Azure services.

## Benefits of Azure DNS

### Reliability and Performance
- **Global Network:** DNS domains are hosted on Azure's global network of DNS name servers.
- **High Availability:** Uses anycast networking to answer DNS queries from the closest available server.
- **Resiliency:** Ensures fast performance and high availability for your domains.

### Security
- **Azure Resource Manager:** Features include Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC), activity logs, and resource locking.
  - **Azure RBAC:** Controls who has access to specific actions.
  - **Activity Logs:** Monitor user modifications and troubleshoot errors.
  - **Resource Locking:** Prevents accidental deletion or modification of critical resources.

### Ease of Use
- **Integration:** Manage DNS records for both Azure services and external resources.
- **Unified Management:** Uses the same credentials, support contract, and billing as other Azure services.
- **Management Tools:** Manage domains and records with Azure portal, Azure PowerShell cmdlets, Azure CLI, REST API, and SDKs.

### Customizable Virtual Networks
- **Private DNS Domains:** Use custom domain names in private virtual networks instead of Azure-provided names.

### Alias Records
- **Dynamic Updates:** Alias record sets can refer to Azure resources (e.g., public IP addresses, Traffic Manager profiles, CDN endpoints).
- **Seamless Updates:** Automatically update DNS records if the IP address of the underlying resource changes.

## Important Note
- **Domain Purchase:** Azure DNS does not support purchasing domain names. Use App Service domains or third-party domain name registrars to buy domains, which can then be hosted in Azure DNS for record management.
