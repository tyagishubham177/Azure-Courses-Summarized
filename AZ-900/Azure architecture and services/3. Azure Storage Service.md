# Azure Storage Accounts

## Overview
An Azure storage account provides a unique namespace for your Azure Storage data, accessible worldwide via HTTP or HTTPS. This data is secure, highly available, durable, and scalable. The type of storage account you create determines the storage services and redundancy options available.

## Storage Account Types and Supported Services

# Azure Storage Redundancy

## Overview
Azure Storage ensures multiple copies of your data are stored to protect against planned and unplanned events such as hardware failures, power outages, and natural disasters. Redundancy options help meet availability and durability targets even in the face of failures.

## Factors to Consider
- **Replication in Primary Region:** How data is replicated within the primary region.
- **Secondary Region Replication:** Whether data is also replicated to a geographically distant secondary region.
- **Read Access Requirements:** Whether the application needs read access to the replicated data in the secondary region if the primary region becomes unavailable.

## Redundancy Options in the Primary Region

### Locally Redundant Storage (LRS)
<img src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-in/training/wwl-azure/describe-azure-storage-services/media/locally-redundant-storage-37247957.png" alt="Static Website Configuration Screenshot" width="500" height="300"> 
- **Replication:** Data is replicated three times within a single data center.
- **Durability:** 99.999999999% (11 nines) durability over a year.
- **Cost:** Lowest-cost redundancy option.
- **Protection:** Guards against server rack and drive failures.
- **Risk:** Vulnerable to data center disasters (e.g., fire, flooding).

### Zone-Redundant Storage (ZRS)
<img src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-in/training/wwl-azure/describe-azure-storage-services/media/zone-redundant-storage-6dd46d22.png" alt="Static Website Configuration Screenshot" width="500" height="300"> 
- **Replication:** Data is replicated synchronously across three availability zones in the primary region.
- **Durability:** 99.9999999999% (12 nines) durability over a year.
- **Accessibility:** Data remains accessible even if a zone becomes unavailable.
- **Recommendation:** Suitable for high availability and data governance within a country or region.

## Redundancy Options in a Secondary Region

### Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS)
- **Replication:** 
  - Primary Region: Three synchronous copies (LRS).
  - Secondary Region: Three asynchronous copies (LRS).
- **Durability:** 99.99999999999999% (16 nines) durability over a year.
- **Usage:** Provides protection against regional disasters.

### Geo-Zone-Redundant Storage (GZRS)
- **Replication:** 
  - Primary Region: Data replicated across three availability zones (ZRS).
  - Secondary Region: Data replicated using LRS.
- **Durability:** 99.99999999999999% (16 nines) durability over a year.
- **Recommendation:** Best for applications needing maximum consistency, durability, availability, and disaster recovery resilience.

## Read Access to Data in the Secondary Region

### Read-Access Geo-Redundant Storage (RA-GRS)
<img src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-in/training/wwl-azure/describe-azure-storage-services/media/geo-redundant-storage-3432d558.png" alt="Static Website Configuration Screenshot" width="500" height="300"> 
- **Function:** Allows read access to data replicated to the secondary region.
- **Benefit:** Data is available even if the primary region is running optimally.
- **Limitation:** Data in the secondary region may not be up-to-date due to Recovery Point Objective (RPO).

### Read-Access Geo-Zone-Redundant Storage (RA-GZRS)
<img src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-in/training/wwl-azure/describe-azure-storage-services/media/geo-zone-redundant-storage-138ab5af.png" alt="Static Website Configuration Screenshot" width="500" height="300"> 
- **Function:** Provides read access to data in the secondary region similar to RA-GRS.
- **Benefit:** Ensures data availability and accessibility during regional outages.
