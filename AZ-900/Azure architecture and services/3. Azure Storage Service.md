# Azure Storage Accounts

## Overview
An Azure storage account provides a unique namespace for your Azure Storage data, accessible worldwide via HTTP or HTTPS. This data is secure, highly available, durable, and scalable. The type of storage account you create determines the storage services and redundancy options available.

## Storage Account Types and Supported Services

## Redundancy Options
- **Locally Redundant Storage (LRS):** Replicates data three times within a single data center.
- **Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS):** Replicates data to a secondary region for high availability.
- **Read-Access Geo-Redundant Storage (RA-GRS):** Read access to the replicated data in the secondary region.
- **Zone-Redundant Storage (ZRS):** Replicates data across multiple availability zones in the same region.
- **Geo-Zone-Redundant Storage (GZRS):** Combines ZRS and GRS for high availability and disaster recovery.
- **Read-Access Geo-Zone-Redundant Storage (RA-GZRS):** Combines RA-GRS and ZRS for read access in secondary regions.

## Storage Account Endpoints
Each storage account has a unique namespace in Azure, defined by the account name and service endpoint. The storage account name must be between 3 and 24 characters, containing only numbers and lowercase letters, and must be unique within Azure.

### Endpoint Formats

| Storage Service            | Endpoint Format                                                   |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Blob Storage               | `https://<storage-account-name>.blob.core.windows.net`             |
| Data Lake Storage Gen2     | `https://<storage-account-name>.dfs.core.windows.net`              |
| Azure Files                | `https://<storage-account-name>.file.core.windows.net`             |
| Queue Storage              | `https://<storage-account-name>.queue.core.windows.net`            |
| Table Storage              | `https://<storage-account-name>.table.core.windows.net`            |

## Key Benefits

- **Alias Records:** Automatically update DNS records to refer to Azure resources.

# Azure Storage Redundancy

## Overview
Azure Storage ensures multiple copies of your data are stored to protect against planned and unplanned events such as hardware failures, power outages, and natural disasters. Redundancy options help meet availability and durability targets even in the face of failures.

## Factors to Consider
- **Replication in Primary Region:** How data is replicated within the primary region.
- **Secondary Region Replication:** Whether data is also replicated to a geographically distant secondary region.
- **Read Access Requirements:** Whether the application needs read access to the replicated data in the secondary region if the primary region becomes unavailable.

## Redundancy Options in the Primary Region

### Locally Redundant Storage (LRS)

- **Replication:** Data is replicated three times within a single data center.
- **Durability:** 99.999999999% (11 nines) durability over a year.
- **Cost:** Lowest-cost redundancy option.
- **Protection:** Guards against server rack and drive failures.
- **Risk:** Vulnerable to data center disasters (e.g., fire, flooding).

### Zone-Redundant Storage (ZRS)

- **Replication:** Data is replicated synchronously across three availability zones in the primary region.
- **Durability:** 99.9999999999% (12 nines) durability over a year.
- **Accessibility:** Data remains accessible even if a zone becomes unavailable.
- **Recommendation:** Suitable for high availability and data governance within a country or region.

## Redundancy Options in a Secondary Region

### Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS)
- **Replication:** 
  - Primary Region: Three synchronous copies (LRS).
  - Secondary Region: Three asynchronous copies (LRS).
- **Durability:** 99.99999999999999% (16 nines) durability over a year.
- **Usage:** Provides protection against regional disasters.

### Geo-Zone-Redundant Storage (GZRS)
- **Replication:** 
  - Primary Region: Data replicated across three availability zones (ZRS).
  - Secondary Region: Data replicated using LRS.
- **Durability:** 99.99999999999999% (16 nines) durability over a year.
- **Recommendation:** Best for applications needing maximum consistency, durability, availability, and disaster recovery resilience.

## Read Access to Data in the Secondary Region

### Read-Access Geo-Redundant Storage (RA-GRS)
<img src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-in/training/wwl-azure/describe-azure-storage-services/media/geo-redundant-storage-3432d558.png" alt="Static Website Configuration Screenshot" width="500" height="300"> 
- **Function:** Allows read access to data replicated to the secondary region.
- **Benefit:** Data is available even if the primary region is running optimally.
- **Limitation:** Data in the secondary region may not be up-to-date due to Recovery Point Objective (RPO).

### Read-Access Geo-Zone-Redundant Storage (RA-GZRS)
<img src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-in/training/wwl-azure/describe-azure-storage-services/media/geo-zone-redundant-storage-138ab5af.png" alt="Static Website Configuration Screenshot" width="500" height="300"> 
- **Function:** Provides read access to data in the secondary region similar to RA-GRS.
- **Benefit:** Ensures data availability and accessibility during regional outages.
