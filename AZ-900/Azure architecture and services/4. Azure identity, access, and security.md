# Azure Authentication Methods

Authentication is the process of establishing the identity of a person, service, or device by providing some type of credential. Azure supports multiple authentication methods to balance security and convenience.

## Authentication Methods in Azure

- **Standard Passwords**
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**
- **Multifactor Authentication (MFA)**
- **Passwordless Authentication**

## Single Sign-On (SSO)

- Enables a user to sign in once and use that credential to access multiple resources and applications.
- Simplifies identity and password management.
- Reduces risk of credential-related security incidents.
- Eases IT management and enhances user convenience.

**Important**: SSO security depends on the initial authenticator's security.

## Multifactor Authentication (MFA)

- Requires an additional form of identification beyond the password.
- Enhances security by requiring two or more elements:
  - Something the user knows (e.g., a challenge question)
  - Something the user has (e.g., a code sent to a mobile phone)
  - Something the user is (e.g., a biometric property)
- Protects against password compromises.

### Microsoft Entra Multifactor Authentication

- Provides multifactor authentication capabilities.
- Users can choose additional forms of authentication, such as a phone call or app notification.

## Passwordless Authentication

- Removes the need for passwords, replacing them with:
  - Something you have (e.g., a registered device)
  - Something you are (e.g., a biometric property)
  - Something you know (e.g., a PIN)
- Provides high security and convenience.

### Passwordless Authentication Options

1. **Windows Hello for Business**
   - Ideal for information workers with designated Windows PCs.
   - Uses biometric and PIN credentials tied to the user's PC.

2. **Microsoft Authenticator App**
   - Turns any iOS or Android phone into a passwordless credential.
   - Uses biometric or PIN for confirmation.

3. **FIDO2 Security Keys**
   - Provides an unphishable, standards-based passwordless authentication method.
   - Can come in various form factors (e.g., USB devices, Bluetooth, NFC).
   - Enhances security by using an external security key or a built-in platform key.

### Comparison of Authentication Methods

| Method               | Security Level | Convenience Level |
|----------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Passwords            | Low            | High              |
| Passwords + 2FA      | High           | Low               |
| Passwordless         | High           | High              |

# Azure External Identities

An external identity refers to a person, device, service, etc., that is outside your organization. Microsoft Entra External ID encompasses all the ways to securely interact with users outside of your organization.

<img src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-in/training/wwl-azure/describe-azure-identity-access-security/media/azure-active-directory-external-identities-5a892021.png" alt="Static Website Configuration Screenshot" width="500" height="600"> 

## Key Features of Azure External Identities

# Azure Conditional Access

Conditional Access is a tool used by Microsoft Entra ID to allow or deny access to resources based on identity signals. These signals include the user's identity, location, and the device used to request access.

## Key Benefits of Conditional Access

- **Empower Users**
  - Enables productivity anywhere and anytime.
  
- **Protect Organizational Assets**
  - Ensures security of resources through adaptive access controls.

## How Conditional Access Works

1. **Signal Collection**
   - Gathers data such as user's location, device, and application being accessed.

2. **Decision Making**
   - Decides to allow, deny, or challenge access based on collected signals.
   - Examples:
     - Full access if signing in from a usual location.
     - Challenge with MFA if signing in from an unusual location.
     - Block access from high-risk locations.

3. **Enforcement**
   - Executes the decision by either granting access, denying access, or requiring MFA.

## Use Cases for Conditional Access

- **Require MFA Based on Conditions**
  - Example: Require MFA for administrators but not regular users.
  
- **Restrict Access to Approved Applications**
  - Example: Allow only certain email applications to connect to your email service.

- **Enforce Access from Managed Devices**
  - Example: Ensure users can only access applications from devices that meet security and compliance standards.

- **Block Access from Untrusted Sources**
  - Example: Block access from unknown or unexpected locations.

## Diagram Illustration

The Conditional Access flow includes:

1. **Signal Collection**
   - Examples: User's location, device type, application.

2. **Decision Making**
   - Allow full access from usual location.
   - Require MFA from unusual location.
   - Block access from high-risk location.

3. **Enforcement**
   - Allow access.
   - Deny access.
   - Require second form of authentication.

# Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a method to manage access to Azure resources by assigning roles to users, groups, or services based on their job functions. This approach adheres to the principle of least privilege, granting only the necessary permissions to perform required tasks.

## Key Features of Azure RBAC

### Built-In and Custom Roles
- **Built-In Roles**: Predefined roles for common access scenarios.
- **Custom Roles**: Define roles with specific sets of permissions tailored to your needs.

### Role Assignment
- Assign individuals or groups to one or more roles.
- Automatically updates permissions for new users or resources within a role.

<img src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-in/training/wwl-azure/describe-azure-identity-access-security/media/role-based-access-scope-4b12a8f3.png" alt="Static Website Configuration Screenshot" width="500" height="300"> 

### Scope Application
- **Scopes**: Define where a role applies, such as management groups, subscriptions, resource groups, or individual resources.

## Hierarchical Access Control

- **Inheritance**: Permissions assigned at a parent scope are inherited by all child scopes.
  - Example: Assigning the Owner role at the management group level allows managing all subscriptions within that group.
  - Example: Assigning the Reader role at the subscription level grants view permissions to all resource groups and resources within that subscription.

### Enforcement of RBAC
- **Azure Resource Manager**: RBAC is enforced on actions initiated through Azure Resource Manager.
  - Access Resource Manager via Azure portal, Azure Cloud Shell, Azure PowerShell, and Azure CLI.
  - Note: RBAC does not enforce permissions at the application or data level; application security must be handled separately.

### Allow Model
- **Allow Model**: Grants permissions based on role assignments.
  - If multiple roles provide different permissions (e.g., read and write) to the same resource, the user gains all those permissions.

## Examples of Role and Scope Combinations

| Role     | Scope           | Permissions                                             |
|----------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Owner    | Management Group| Manage all resources within the management group        |
| Reader   | Subscription    | View all resource groups and resources within the subscription |
| Contributor | Resource Group | Manage resources within the resource group               |

# Zero Trust Model

The Zero Trust security model assumes a worst-case scenario and protects resources accordingly. It starts with the assumption that a breach has already occurred and verifies each request as if it originated from an uncontrolled network.

## Key Principles of Zero Trust

### 1. Verify Explicitly
- Always authenticate and authorize based on all available data points.
- Use signals such as user identity, location, device health, and service or workload.

### 2. Use Least Privilege Access
- Limit user access with Just-In-Time (JIT) and Just-Enough-Access (JEA).
- Implement risk-based adaptive policies and data protection measures.

### 3. Assume Breach
- Minimize blast radius and segment access to contain breaches.
- Verify end-to-end encryption and use analytics for visibility and threat detection.
- Continuously improve defenses.

## Adjusting to Zero Trust

### Traditional Security Model
- Corporate networks were restricted and assumed safe.
- Only managed devices could join the network.
- VPN access was tightly controlled, and personal devices were often restricted or blocked.

### Zero Trust Model
- Requires authentication for every access request, regardless of location.
- Grants access based on authentication rather than network location.
- Protects people, devices, applications, and data wherever they are located.

## Benefits of Zero Trust

- **Enhanced Security**: Protects against breaches by not assuming any device or user is safe.
- **Adaptability**: Fits the complexity of modern environments and the mobile workforce.
- **Data Protection**: Ensures that data is protected through continuous verification and segmentation.

# Defense-in-Depth

The objective of defense-in-depth is to protect information and prevent unauthorized access. It employs a series of mechanisms to slow down an attack aimed at acquiring unauthorized data access.
