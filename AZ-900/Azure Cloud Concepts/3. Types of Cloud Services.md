# Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

## Definition
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a cloud service model that provides the highest level of control over cloud resources. The cloud provider maintains the physical hardware, network connectivity, and physical security, while the user is responsible for the rest.

### Cloud Provider
- Maintaining hardware
- Network connectivity to the internet
- Physical security

### User
- Operating system installation, configuration, and maintenance
- Network configuration
- Database and storage configuration
- Security management

## Shared Responsibility Model
IaaS places the largest share of responsibility on the user. The cloud provider handles the physical infrastructure, while the user manages installation, configuration, patching, updates, and security.



## Common Scenarios

### Lift-and-Shift Migration
- Setting up cloud resources similar to on-premises datacenter
- Moving existing on-prem applications to IaaS infrastructure

### Testing and Development
- Rapidly replicate established configurations for development and testing environments
- Start up or shut down environments quickly while maintaining control

# Platform as a Service (PaaS)

## Definition
Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a cloud service model that provides a balanced approach between Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS). The cloud provider manages the physical infrastructure, security, internet connectivity, operating systems, middleware, development tools, and business intelligence services. Users do not need to worry about licensing or patching for these components.

## Responsibilities

### Cloud Provider
- Maintaining physical infrastructure
- Ensuring physical security
- Managing internet connectivity
- Operating systems maintenance
- Middleware and development tools management
- Business intelligence services maintenance

### User
- Application development
- Data management
- Application security

## Shared Responsibility Model
In the PaaS model, responsibilities are split between the cloud provider and the user. The cloud provider takes care of the physical infrastructure, internet access, operating systems, and development tools, while the user focuses on application development, data management, and application security.

## Common Scenarios

### Development Framework
- PaaS provides a framework for developing and customizing cloud-based applications.
- Built-in software components reduce the amount of coding needed.
- Features such as scalability, high availability, and multi-tenancy are included.

### Analytics or Business Intelligence
- Tools for analyzing and mining data.
- Helps find insights, patterns, and predict outcomes.
- Improves forecasting, product design, investment returns, and business decisions.

# Software as a Service (SaaS)

## Definition
Software as a Service (SaaS) is the most comprehensive cloud service model from a product perspective. In SaaS, users rent or use fully developed applications. Examples include email, financial software, messaging applications, and connectivity software. It is the least flexible but the easiest to implement, requiring minimal technical knowledge.

## Shared Responsibility Model

### Cloud Provider Responsibilities
- Physical security of datacenters
- Power and network connectivity
- Application development and maintenance
- Patching and updates

### User Responsibilities
- Data input and management
- Device management
- User access control

## Common Scenarios

### Email and Messaging
- Applications such as Gmail, Outlook, and Slack

### Business Productivity Applications
- Tools like Microsoft Office 365, Google Workspace

### Finance and Expense Tracking
- Applications like QuickBooks, Expensify
