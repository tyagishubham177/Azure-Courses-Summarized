# Shared Responsibility Model in Cloud Computing

## Traditional Corporate Datacenter

  - Maintain physical space and security
  - Maintain/replace servers
  - Keep systems patched and on the correct version

## Shared Responsibility Model
### Cloud Provider Responsibilities
- Physical security
- Power
- Cooling
- Network connectivity
- Physical datacenter, network, and hosts

### Consumer Responsibilities
- Data and information stored in the cloud
- Access security (managing user access)
- Devices allowed to connect to the cloud
- Accounts and identities of users, services, and devices

### Shared Responsibilities (Situational)
- **Cloud SQL Database**:
  - Provider: Maintains the database
  - Consumer: Manages data ingestion and content
- **Virtual Machine with SQL Database**:
  - Provider: Supplies the virtual machine
  - Consumer: Maintains database patches, updates, and data

## Cloud Service Types and Responsibilities
- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**:
  - Consumer: Most responsibilities (OS, applications, data)
  - Provider: Basics (physical security, power, connectivity)
  
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**:
  - Shared responsibilities
  - Provider: Manages infrastructure and middleware
  - Consumer: Manages applications and data

- **Software as a Service (SaaS)**:
  - Provider: Most responsibilities (applications, infrastructure)
  - Consumer: Manages data and user access

# Cloud Models

## Definition
Cloud models define the deployment types of cloud resources. The three main cloud models are private, public, and hybrid.

### Private Cloud
- **Description**: Used by a single entity, offering greater control over IT services.
- **Advantages**:
  - Greater control for the company and IT department
  - Enhanced security
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Higher costs
  - Fewer benefits compared to public cloud
- **Deployment**:
  - On-site datacenter
  - Dedicated offsite datacenter, potentially by a third party

### Public Cloud
- **Description**: Built, controlled, and maintained by a third-party cloud provider.
- **Advantages**:
  - No capital expenditures to scale up
  - Quick provisioning and deprovisioning of applications
  - Pay-as-you-go model
- **Disadvantages**:
  - No complete control over resources and security
- **Availability**: Accessible to anyone who wants to purchase cloud services

### Hybrid Cloud
- **Description**: Combines both public and private clouds in an interconnected environment.
- **Advantages**:
  - Most flexibility
  - Control over security, compliance, and legal requirements
  - Ability to surge public cloud resources for increased demand
- **Usage**:
  - Choose which services to keep in public or private cloud
  - Enhanced security and resource management

## Comparative Aspects

| Aspect                                        | Public Cloud                                  | Private Cloud                                                 | Hybrid Cloud                              |
|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Capital Expenditures                          | No capital expenditures to scale up           | Hardware must be purchased for startup and maintenance        | Organizations determine where to run applications |
| Application Provisioning                      | Quickly provisioned and deprovisioned         | Complete control over resources and security                  | Most flexibility                          |
| Cost                                          | Pay only for what they use                    | Organizations responsible for hardware maintenance and updates | Control over security, compliance, or legal requirements |
| Control over Resources and Security           | No complete control                           | Data is not collocated with other organizations' data          | Organizations control security            |

### Multi-cloud
- **Description**: Use of multiple public cloud providers.
- **Advantages**:
  - Utilize different features from various cloud providers
  - Flexibility in migrating between providers
- **Management**: Deal with multiple public cloud providers and manage resources and security in both environments.

### Azure Arc
- **Function**: Set of technologies to manage cloud environments.
- **Capability**: Manage public cloud, private cloud, hybrid configurations, and multi-cloud environments.

### Azure VMware Solution
- **Function**: Enables running VMware workloads in Azure.
- **Benefits**: Seamless integration and scalability for established VMware private cloud environments transitioning to public or hybrid cloud.

# Consumption-Based Model

## Types of Expenses
- **Capital Expenditure (CapEx)**: One-time, upfront expenditure for tangible resources.
  - Examples: Building a datacenter, purchasing a vehicle, constructing a new building.
- **Operational Expenditure (OpEx)**: Ongoing expenditure for services or products over time.
  - Examples: Leasing a vehicle, renting a convention center, subscribing to cloud services.

## Cloud Computing as OpEx
- Operates on a consumption-based model.
- Payment is for IT resources used, not for physical infrastructure or maintenance.

## Benefits of Consumption-Based Model
- **No upfront costs**: Avoid large initial investments.
- **Cost efficiency**: Pay only for resources used, avoiding underutilization.
- **Scalability**: Easily add or remove resources based on demand.
- **Flexibility**: Adjust resource usage without long-term commitments.

## Traditional Datacenter vs. Cloud-Based Model
- **Traditional Datacenter**:
  - Requires estimation of future resource needs.
  - Risks of overestimation (wasted money) or underestimation (decreased performance).
  - Time-consuming adjustments for under-provisioned datacenters.
- **Cloud-Based Model**:
  - No need for precise resource estimation.
  - Quick addition or removal of resources as needed.
  - Pay only for the resources used, not for extra capacity.

## Cloud Pricing Models
- **Pay-as-you-go**: Payment only for the cloud services used.
  - Helps in planning and managing operating costs.
  - Enhances efficiency and scalability based on business needs.
- **Renting Compute Power and Storage**:
  - Treat cloud resources as in-house datacenter resources.
  - Return resources when no longer needed, paying only for usage.
