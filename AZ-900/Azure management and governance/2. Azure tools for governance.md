# Purpose of Azure Policy

Azure Policy is a service in Azure that enables the creation, assignment, and management of policies to control or audit resource configurations, ensuring compliance with corporate standards.

## Key Features

### Policy Definition
- **Individual Policies:** Specific rules applied to resource configurations.
- **Initiatives:** Groups of related policies aimed at achieving broader compliance goals.

### Compliance Monitoring
- **Resource Evaluation:** Continuously evaluates resources and highlights noncompliant configurations.
- **Prevention:** Can prevent the creation of noncompliant resources.

### Policy Inheritance
- **Hierarchy Application:** Policies set at higher levels (e.g., subscriptions, resource groups) are inherited by all subordinate resources.
- **Example:** A policy set at a resource group level applies to all resources within that group.

### Built-in Definitions
- **Predefined Policies:** Includes built-in definitions for Storage, Networking, Compute, Security Center, and Monitoring.
- **Examples:**
  - Restricting VM sizes.
  - Ensuring tags like `AppName` are applied to resources.

### Automatic Remediation
- **Auto-fix:** Automatically corrects noncompliant configurations (e.g., applying missing tags).
- **Exceptions:** Allows flagging specific resources to exclude them from automatic remediation.

### Integration with Azure DevOps
- **CI/CD Pipelines:** Applies policies during the pre-deployment and post-deployment phases of applications.

## Example Initiatives

### Enable Monitoring in Azure Security Center
- **Goal:** Monitor security recommendations for all Azure resource types.
- **Included Policies:**
  - **Monitor unencrypted SQL Database:** Ensures SQL databases and servers are encrypted.
  - **Monitor OS vulnerabilities:** Checks for servers that do not meet OS vulnerability baselines.
  - **Monitor missing Endpoint Protection:** Ensures servers have an endpoint protection agent installed.
- **Scope:** Over 100 policy definitions to ensure comprehensive monitoring and compliance.

## Benefits

- **Compliance Enforcement:** Ensures resources adhere to corporate standards and regulatory requirements.
- **Resource Management:** Helps manage and audit resource configurations across the Azure environment.
- **Security:** Enhances security by monitoring and remediating noncompliant configurations.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Automates compliance tasks, reducing manual efforts.

# Purpose of Resource Locks

Resource locks in Azure are a security feature that prevents critical resources from being accidentally deleted or modified. This adds an extra layer of protection even when role-based access control (RBAC) policies are in place.

## Key Features

### Protection Against Accidental Changes
- **Prevention:** Ensures that resources cannot be accidentally deleted or altered by users, even those with appropriate access levels.
- **Scope:** Can be applied to individual resources, resource groups, or entire subscriptions.
- **Inheritance:** Locks applied at higher levels (e.g., resource groups) are inherited by all subordinate resources.

### Types of Resource Locks

1. **Delete Lock**
   - **Function:** Prevents users from deleting the resource.
   - **Permissions:** Authorized users can read and modify the resource but cannot delete it.

2. **ReadOnly Lock**
   - **Function:** Prevents users from deleting or updating the resource.
   - **Permissions:** Authorized users can read the resource but cannot delete or modify it. Similar to restricting users to the Reader role.

### Managing Resource Locks

- **Azure Portal:** Access the Settings section of any resource's pane to view, add, or delete locks.
- **PowerShell:** Use PowerShell commands to manage locks.
- **Azure CLI:** Utilize Azure CLI for lock management.
- **Azure Resource Manager Templates:** Define locks within resource manager templates.

### Modifying Locked Resources

- **Two-Step Process:** To modify a locked resource, you must:
  1. Remove the lock.
  2. Perform the desired action (delete or update).
- **RBAC Independence:** Locks are independent of RBAC permissions. Even resource owners must remove the lock to perform blocked actions.

## Benefits

- **Enhanced Security:** Prevents accidental or unauthorized modifications.
- **Operational Safety:** Ensures critical resources remain intact and unchanged unless explicitly unlocked.
- **Compliance:** Supports organizational policies and compliance requirements by safeguarding key resources.
