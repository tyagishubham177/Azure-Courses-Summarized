# Factors Affecting Costs in Azure

Azure shifts development costs from capital expenses (CapEx) to operational expenses (OpEx), impacting costs based on several factors:

## Resource Type
- **Influencing Factors:** Type, settings, and region of the resource.
- **Examples:**
  - **Storage Account:** Type (blob), performance tier, access tier, redundancy settings, and region.
  - **Virtual Machine:** Licensing, processor and cores, storage, and network interface.

## Consumption
- **Pay-As-You-Go:** Pay for the resources used during a billing cycle.
- **Reserved Resources:** Commit to using a set amount of resources in advance for discounts (up to 72%).

## Maintenance
- **Resource Groups:** Organize and maintain cloud environments to control costs.
- **Deprovisioning:** Ensure additional resources are deprovisioned when no longer needed.

## Geography
- **Regional Deployment:** Costs vary by region due to power, labor, taxes, and fees.
- **Network Traffic:** Costs differ based on data transfer within or between regions.

## Network Traffic
- **Billing Zones:** Geographical grouping of Azure regions for billing purposes.
- **Bandwidth:** Inbound data transfers are often free; outbound transfers are charged based on zones.

## Subscription Type
- **Usage Allowances:** Some subscription types include free trials and credit allowances.
  - **Example:** Azure free trial provides access to products free for 12 months with initial credits.

## Azure Marketplace
- **Third-Party Solutions:** Purchase solutions from third-party vendors, incurring additional costs for services or expertise.
- **Certification:** Solutions are certified and compliant with Azure policies.

# Comparison of Pricing and Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculators

## Overview
Both calculators are tools provided by Azure to help estimate potential expenses, but they serve different purposes and provide distinct types of insights.

## Pricing Calculator

  - Focus on provisioned resource costs in Azure.
- **Features:**
  - Estimate costs for compute, storage, and network.
  - Include different storage options (type, access tier, redundancy).
- **Note:** 
  - The calculator is for information purposes only.
  - Estimates do not result in actual provisioning or charges.
- **Example Usage:**
  - Estimating the cost of a virtual machine setup with specific storage and network requirements.

## TCO Calculator
- **Purpose:** Compares costs of running on-premises infrastructure versus Azure Cloud infrastructure.
- **Usage:**
  - Enter current infrastructure configuration (servers, databases, storage, network traffic).
  - Compare anticipated costs between current environment and Azure.
- **Features:**
  - Input assumptions like power and IT labor costs.
  - Estimate cost differences between on-premises and Azure environments.
- **Example Usage:**
  - Calculating potential savings by migrating a company's datacenter to Azure.

# Microsoft Cost Management Tool

  - Explore organizational costs to identify spending trends.
  - Estimate monthly, quarterly, or yearly cost trends against a budget.

### Cost Alerts
- **Purpose:** Notify users about different spending conditions.
- **Types of Alerts:**
  - **Budget Alerts:** Triggered when spending reaches or exceeds defined budget conditions.
  - **Credit Alerts:** Notify when Azure credit balance is consumed, applicable for Enterprise Agreements.
  - **Department Spending Quota Alerts:** Notify when departmental spending reaches a set percentage of the quota.

### Budgets
- **Purpose:** Set spending limits for Azure resources.
- **Capabilities:**
  - Define budgets based on subscription, resource group, service type, etc.
  - Configure budget alerts to notify when spending thresholds are met.
  - Automate resource management based on budget conditions.

## Usage Scenarios
- **Rapid Provisioning:** Quickly provision resources to meet demand or test new features.
- **Accidental Provisioning:** Detect accidental provisioning before receiving an invoice.
- **Cost Trends:** Monitor and analyze cost trends to stay within budget.

## Example Use Cases

| Feature                     | Description                                                                                          |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| **Credit Alerts**           | Notify when Azure credit is consumed, ensuring awareness of credit balance status.                   |
| **Department Spending Alerts** | Notify when departmental spending reaches quota thresholds, helping manage departmental budgets.      |
| **Budgets**                 | Set and manage spending limits, automate resource management based on budget conditions.             |

# Purpose of Tags in Azure

Tags in Azure are a way to add metadata to your resources, aiding in organization, management, and optimization of your cloud usage. Tags consist of a name and value pair and can be applied to various levels, such as resources, resource groups, and subscriptions.

## Benefits of Using Tags

### Resource Management
- **Purpose:** Locate and manage resources associated with specific workloads, environments, business units, and owners.

### Cost Management and Optimization
- **Purpose:** Group resources for cost reporting, allocate internal cost centers, track budgets, and forecast costs.

### Operations Management
- **Purpose:** Group resources based on their criticality to business operations, aiding in formulating service-level agreements (SLAs).

### Security
- **Purpose:** Classify data by security levels, such as public or confidential.

### Governance and Regulatory Compliance
- **Purpose:** Identify resources that comply with governance or regulatory requirements (e.g., ISO 27001).
- **Enforcement:** Use tags for standards enforcement, like requiring an owner or department name.

### Workload Optimization and Automation
- **Purpose:** Visualize resources in complex deployments and automate tasks using tools like Azure DevOps.

## Managing Resource Tags

### Methods
- **Windows PowerShell**
- **Azure CLI**
- **Azure Resource Manager Templates**
- **REST API**
- **Azure Portal**

### Tagging Policies
- **Azure Policy:** Enforce tagging rules and conventions, such as requiring tags on new resources or reapplying removed tags.

## Example Tagging Structure

| Name        | Value                             |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| AppName     | The name of the application       |
| CostCenter  | Internal cost center code         |
| Owner       | Business owner's name             |
| Environment | Environment name (e.g., Prod, Dev, Test) |
| Impact      | Business importance (e.g., Mission-critical, High-impact, Low-impact) |

## Key Points
- Tags are not inherited across different levels (resource, resource group, subscription), allowing custom tagging schemas.
- Tags help in organization, cost management, operations, security, compliance, and automation.
- You can choose to apply specific tags only to relevant resources, such as applying the Impact tag only to mission-critical resources.
