# Azure-Courses-Summarized 📝

This repo is a summary of Azure courses. Done with the help of Custom GPT.
The aim is to reduce the time taken to go through Azure courses by a third. No text is omitted. You can still make notes out of this but the aim is to change long unreadable paragraphs into bite-sized content to increase the speed of information consumption.
